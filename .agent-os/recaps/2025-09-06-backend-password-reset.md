# [2025-09-06] Recap: Backend Password Reset

This recaps what was built for the spec documented at .agent-os/specs/2025-09-06-backend-password-reset/spec.md.

## Recap

Implemented a complete backend password reset functionality for the Crud application, providing secure password recovery through email verification. The implementation follows Clean Architecture principles and includes comprehensive security measures such as cryptographically secure token generation, rate limiting, and protection against email enumeration attacks.

Key deliverables:
- **Domain Layer**: PasswordResetToken entity with secure token generation and validation
- **Application Layer**: CQRS command handlers for forgot password, reset password, and token validation
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Repository implementation, email service abstraction, and EF Core migrations
- **API Layer**: Three new endpoints with rate limiting and proper security headers
- **Testing**: 69 unit tests, 9 integration tests, and 9 E2E test scenarios
- **Security**: Rate limiting (3 requests/15 min), constant-time token comparison, HTTPS enforcement

## Context

Implement secure backend password reset functionality with email verification to complete the authentication system. The feature includes three API endpoints (forgot-password, reset-password, validate-reset-token), cryptographically secure token generation with 1-hour expiration, email service integration, and rate limiting to prevent abuse. This backend implementation will integrate with the already-completed Angular frontend password reset UI.
