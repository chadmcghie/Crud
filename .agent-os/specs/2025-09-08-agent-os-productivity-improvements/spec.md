> Spec: Agent OS Productivity Improvements
> Created: 2025-09-08
> GitHub Issue: #152 - Agent OS Productivity Improvements

## Overview

Implement a comprehensive set of productivity improvements to transform Agent OS from a collection of tools into a cohesive productivity system. These improvements will reduce cognitive load, speed up task initiation, and enable better project management through automated agent orchestration and templating systems.

## User Stories

### Quick Command Access

As a developer, I want to quickly access Agent OS commands through a dashboard or shortcuts, so that I can initiate tasks without remembering complex command structures.

Currently, accessing Agent OS commands requires navigating through multiple folders and remembering specific file names. With a quick-start dashboard and shell aliases, developers can initiate common workflows with simple commands like `aos-spec` or `aos-execute`, reducing task initiation time by 50%.

### Automated Agent Orchestration

As a developer, I want an orchestrator that automatically delegates to appropriate specialized agents, so that I don't have to manually select and sequence agents for complex workflows.

The current system has 7 specialized agents but requires manual selection and sequencing. An orchestrator agent will analyze requests, delegate to appropriate agents, manage sequencing (e.g., test → review → git), and prevent circular dependencies, reducing errors by 70%.

### Reusable Task Templates

As a developer working on CRUD applications, I want reusable task templates for common patterns, so that I can quickly generate consistent task lists without repetitive manual work.

Creating tasks for common patterns like CRUD operations, API endpoints, or Angular components requires repetitive manual specification. With templates, developers can generate 80% of their task structure automatically, ensuring consistency and saving time.

## Spec Scope

1. **Command Dashboard** - Create a quick-reference dashboard with one-line commands and shell aliases for all Agent OS operations
2. **Agent Orchestrator** - Develop a meta-agent that analyzes requests and automatically delegates to specialized agents with proper sequencing
3. **Task Templates Library** - Create reusable templates for common patterns (CRUD features, API endpoints, Angular components) in `.agent-os/templates/`
4. **Progress Tracking System** - Implement a status dashboard showing spec/task completion across projects with review history
5. **Learning Cache** - Add a system to track common issues and solutions for quick reference during development

## Out of Scope

- Migration of existing specs to new template formats
- Integration with external project management tools
- Automated deployment or CI/CD pipeline modifications
- Changes to existing agent implementations (only orchestration layer)
- Modifications to existing standards or code style guides

## Expected Deliverable

1. A working command dashboard accessible via shell aliases that reduces command lookup time to near-zero
2. An orchestrator agent that successfully routes requests to appropriate specialized agents without manual intervention
3. A templates folder with at least 5 reusable task templates demonstrating 80% faster task creation for common patterns
