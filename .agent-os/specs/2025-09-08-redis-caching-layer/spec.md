> Spec: Redis Caching Layer

> GitHub Issue: #37 - Implement Distributed Caching Layer (Redis/LazyCache)

## Overview

Implement a comprehensive distributed caching layer using Redis and LazyCache to reduce database load and improve application response times. This feature will provide both distributed caching for multi-instance deployments and optimized in-process caching for single-instance scenarios, targeting support for 1000+ concurrent users with <200ms response times.

## User Stories

### High-Volume API Consumer

As an API consumer making frequent requests, I want responses to be served from cache when appropriate, so that I receive data faster and with consistent performance.

When I make repeated GET requests for the same resource, the first request fetches from the database and caches the result, while subsequent requests within the TTL window are served directly from cache. The system automatically invalidates cached data when the underlying resource is modified through POST, PUT, or DELETE operations.

### System Administrator

As a system administrator, I want to monitor and manage the caching layer, so that I can ensure optimal performance and troubleshoot issues when they arise.

I need visibility into cache hit/miss ratios, memory usage, and the ability to manually clear specific cache keys or entire cache regions when necessary. The system should provide health check endpoints and metrics that integrate with our existing monitoring infrastructure.

### Developer

As a developer working with the CRUD template, I want caching to be transparently integrated into the Clean Architecture pattern, so that I can benefit from performance improvements without modifying existing business logic.

The caching layer should work seamlessly with MediatR queries, repository patterns, and API endpoints through decorators and behaviors, allowing me to control caching through attributes or configuration rather than explicit code changes.

## Spec Scope

1. **Core Caching Infrastructure** - Implement Redis integration with fallback to in-memory caching when Redis is unavailable
2. **Repository Caching Decorators** - Create decorator pattern implementation for automatic repository-level caching
3. **CQRS Query Caching** - Add MediatR behavior for caching query results with configurable TTL
4. **API Response Caching** - Implement output caching for GET endpoints with cache invalidation on mutations
5. **Cache Management & Monitoring** - Provide management endpoints, health checks, and metrics for cache operations

## Out of Scope

- Session state management (will use existing ASP.NET Core session providers)
- Distributed locking mechanisms (separate concern for future implementation)
- Cache warming/preloading strategies (manual implementation if needed)
- Cross-region cache replication (single-region focus for initial implementation)

## Expected Deliverable

1. Fully functional Redis caching with automatic fallback to in-memory cache when Redis is unavailable, demonstrating >80% cache hit ratio for read operations
2. Repository and CQRS query caching reducing database load by 60-80% during peak usage, measurable through provided metrics endpoints
3. API response caching with proper cache invalidation on data mutations, testable through E2E tests showing consistent data after updates
