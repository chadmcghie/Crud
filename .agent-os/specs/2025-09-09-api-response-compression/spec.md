> Spec: API Response Compression Implementation
> Created: 2025-09-09
> GitHub Issue: #179 - API Response Compression Implementation

## Overview

Implement HTTP response compression (Gzip/Brotli) in the .NET API to reduce bandwidth usage and improve response times by 60-80% for all API endpoints and static files.

## User Stories

### Performance Improvement

As a **mobile user with limited bandwidth**, I want API responses to be compressed, so that I can load data faster and use less of my data plan.

**Detailed Workflow:**
1. User makes API request from mobile device
2. Server compresses JSON response using Gzip/Brotli
3. Client receives smaller response (60-80% reduction)
4. Client automatically decompresses response
5. User experiences faster loading times

### Developer Experience

As a **developer**, I want compression to work transparently, so that I don't need to modify existing API code or client applications.

**Detailed Workflow:**
1. Developer enables compression middleware in Program.cs
2. All existing API endpoints automatically support compression
3. Angular frontend receives compressed responses without code changes
4. Developer can monitor compression metrics and performance

## Spec Scope

1. **Response Compression Middleware** - Configure ASP.NET Core compression with Gzip and Brotli providers
2. **HTTPS Compression Support** - Enable compression over secure connections
3. **Static File Compression** - Compress CSS, JavaScript, and other static assets
4. **Compression Configuration** - Set optimal compression levels and provider preferences
5. **Performance Monitoring** - Add metrics to track compression effectiveness

## Out of Scope

- Response caching (separate feature - Issue #94)
- Client-side compression
- Custom compression algorithms
- Compression of already compressed files (images, videos)

## Expected Deliverable

1. All API responses compressed when client supports compression (60-80% size reduction)
2. Static files (CSS, JS) compressed for faster frontend loading
3. HTTPS compression enabled without security warnings
4. Compression metrics available for monitoring performance improvements
