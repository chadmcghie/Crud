# Spec Summary (Lite)

Optimize E2E test execution by eliminating unnecessary server restarts between test runs, reducing startup time from 90-100 seconds to under 5 seconds through intelligent server reuse and database-only resets. The system will detect running servers, reuse them across test executions, and only reset the database for data isolation, dramatically improving developer productivity and CI/CD efficiency.
