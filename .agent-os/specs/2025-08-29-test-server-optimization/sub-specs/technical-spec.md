# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-08-29-test-server-optimization/spec.md

## Technical Requirements

### Domain Layer Changes
- No domain entity changes required
- Potential addition of test-specific database reset service interface

### Application Layer Changes
- New use case: ResetTestDatabaseCommand for controlled database cleanup
- Interface: ITestDatabaseService for database reset operations
- DTO: DatabaseResetRequest containing reset parameters and safety tokens

### Infrastructure Layer Changes
- Implementation of TestDatabaseService for SQLite-specific reset operations
- Enhanced global setup script (smart-global-setup.ts) with server detection logic
- Server health check endpoints for reliable detection
- Port availability checking before server startup attempts

### Presentation Layer Changes
- Optional: Protected database reset endpoint (only in Testing environment)
- Server status indicators in test console output
- Clear logging of server reuse vs. new startup

### Integration Requirements
- Playwright global setup/teardown hook modifications
- Environment variable management for server URLs and ports
- Process management for server lifecycle across test runs

### Performance Criteria
- Server detection must complete in under 2 seconds
- Database reset operation must complete in under 3 seconds
- Total overhead for subsequent test runs must not exceed 5 seconds
- Memory usage should remain stable across multiple test runs
