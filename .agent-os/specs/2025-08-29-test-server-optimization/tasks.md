# Spec Tasks

## Tasks

- [ ] 1. Implement Smart Server Detection and Reuse
  - [ ] 1.1 Write tests for server detection logic
  - [ ] 1.2 Create isServerRunning() function to check if servers are already active
  - [ ] 1.3 Modify global setup to check for existing servers before starting new ones
  - [ ] 1.4 Add server status logging to show when reusing vs starting
  - [ ] 1.5 Update teardown logic to preserve servers that were already running
  - [ ] 1.6 Verify all server detection tests pass

- [ ] 2. Implement Database-Only Reset Mechanism
  - [ ] 2.1 Write tests for database reset functionality
  - [ ] 2.2 Create secure database reset endpoint with environment checks
  - [ ] 2.3 Add security controls (localhost-only, token validation)
  - [ ] 2.4 Implement resetDatabase() function in test setup
  - [ ] 2.5 Configure reset endpoint to only exist in Testing environment
  - [ ] 2.6 Test data isolation between consecutive test runs
  - [ ] 2.7 Verify all database reset tests pass

- [ ] 3. Update Test Configuration Files
  - [ ] 3.1 Write tests for configuration changes
  - [ ] 3.2 Update all playwright.config files to use smart-global-setup
  - [ ] 3.3 Remove redundant server restart logic from test fixtures
  - [ ] 3.4 Add environment variables for server URL persistence
  - [ ] 3.5 Update package.json scripts to support server reuse
  - [ ] 3.6 Verify all configuration tests pass

- [ ] 4. Performance Validation and Documentation
  - [ ] 4.1 Write performance benchmark tests
  - [ ] 4.2 Measure and document baseline startup times (before optimization)
  - [ ] 4.3 Measure optimized startup times (after implementation)
  - [ ] 4.4 Create documentation for the new test execution flow
  - [ ] 4.5 Update README with server management best practices
  - [ ] 4.6 Verify performance meets <5 second requirement
  - [ ] 4.7 Run full test suite to ensure backwards compatibility
  - [ ] 4.8 Verify all validation tests pass
