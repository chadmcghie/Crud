> Spec: Test Server Optimization
> Created: 2025-08-29
> Status: COMPLETED

## Overview

Optimize E2E test execution by eliminating unnecessary server restarts and implementing intelligent server reuse. This feature will reduce test startup time from 90-100 seconds to under 5 seconds for subsequent test runs, dramatically improving developer productivity and CI/CD pipeline efficiency.

## User Stories

### Developer Test Execution

As a developer, I want to run E2E tests multiple times without waiting for server restarts, so that I can iterate quickly and maintain flow state during development.

When I run tests for the first time, the system should start the necessary servers (API and Angular). For subsequent test runs, the system should detect that servers are already running and only reset the database, allowing tests to begin in under 5 seconds instead of waiting 90+ seconds for server compilation and startup.

### CI/CD Pipeline Optimization

As a DevOps engineer, I want the test pipeline to reuse servers intelligently, so that our CI/CD runs complete faster and consume fewer resources.

The test infrastructure should maintain server processes across multiple test suite executions within the same pipeline run, only restarting servers when necessary (e.g., configuration changes) while ensuring complete data isolation between test runs through database resets.

## Spec Scope

1. **Smart Server Detection** - Detect if API and Angular servers are already running on expected ports before attempting to start new instances
2. **Database-Only Reset** - Implement a mechanism to reset only the database between test runs while keeping servers running
3. **Server Lifecycle Management** - Intelligently manage server processes, only starting them when needed and preserving them across test runs
4. **Backwards Compatibility** - Ensure the solution works with existing test suites without requiring test modifications
5. **Security Controls** - Implement proper security measures for any database reset mechanisms to prevent accidental data loss

## Out of Scope

- Parallel test execution (maintaining serial execution per ADR-001)
- Database provider changes (continuing with SQLite for tests)
- Test framework migration (staying with Playwright)
- Production database reset capabilities

## Expected Deliverable

1. Test runs after initial setup complete startup in under 5 seconds with visible console confirmation of server reuse
2. Running the test suite twice in succession shows the second run using existing servers with only database reset occurring
3. Clean test data isolation verified by creating data in one test run and confirming it's absent in the next run

## Implementation Notes

**Status: COMPLETED** - All tasks have been successfully implemented. The test server optimization was achieved through a different approach than originally specified in the implementation process:

- Instead of implementing a complex server detection and reuse mechanism, we leveraged Playwright's built-in webServer configuration
- The webServer configuration automatically manages server lifecycle, starting servers only when needed
- Database isolation is achieved through unique database filenames per test run
- Performance improvements were achieved through the webServer's efficient server management
- All deliverables met: startup times reduced, server reuse working, and test data isolation confirmed
