## Implementation Summary

**Status: COMPLETED** - E2E test simplification achieved through Playwright's webServer configuration approach:

- Implemented using Playwright's built-in webServer instead of custom server management
- Serial execution enforced with workers=1 configuration
- Database isolation achieved through unique database filenames per test run
- CI/CD pipeline simplified to use standard Playwright commands
- All test reliability and performance goals met
