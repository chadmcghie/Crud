# Smoke Test Authentication Failure in CI Pipeline

## Problem Statement
The authentication smoke test is failing in the GitHub Actions CI pipeline but passing locally, causing PR validation to fail and blocking merges.

## Symptoms
- Test fails with exit code 1 in GitHub Actions
- Test passes successfully when run locally
- Error occurs specifically in the "Run Simple Authentication Test" step
- Affects PR #17340739095

## Impact
- All PRs are blocked from merging
- CI/CD pipeline is broken
- Development velocity is impacted
- Team cannot validate changes through automated testing

## Root Cause Analysis (Five Whys)
1. Why did the authentication test fail in CI? The test execution failed with exit code 1
2. Why did it fail with exit code 1? The test step doesn't have `continue-on-error: true` like other smoke tests
3. Why doesn't it have continue-on-error? Inconsistent error handling configuration across smoke tests
4. Why is the configuration inconsistent? The workflow was recently modified without consistent error handling
5. Why was it modified inconsistently? Missing CI configuration standards for smoke tests (ROOT CAUSE)

## Attempted Solutions

### Attempt 1: [2025-08-30 00:55]
**Approach**: Added detailed logging and verification for appsettings files in smoke test setup
**Result**: Improved diagnostics but didn't resolve the core issue
**Files Modified**: 
- .github/workflows/pr-validation.yml (lines 231-250)
**Key Learning**: Appsettings files are being copied correctly, issue is with test execution configuration

### Attempt 2: [2025-08-30 01:00]
**Approach**: Verified test passes locally with same configuration
**Result**: Test passes locally, confirming CI-specific issue
**Files Modified**:
- None (local testing only)
**Key Learning**: Issue is specific to CI environment configuration, not test code

### Attempt 3: [2025-08-30 01:02]
**Approach**: Analyzed workflow configuration for inconsistencies
**Result**: Found missing `continue-on-error` flag on authentication test
**Files Modified**:
- None (analysis only)
**Key Learning**: Smoke tests have inconsistent error handling configuration

## Strategic Changes (DO NOT ROLLBACK)
List of improvements made during troubleshooting that must be preserved:
- [x] File: .github/workflows/pr-validation.yml - Lines: 39-43 - Change: Added appsettings verification step - Reason: Ensures configuration files exist before artifact upload
- [x] File: .github/workflows/pr-validation.yml - Lines: 234-250 - Change: Enhanced smoke test setup with detailed logging - Reason: Provides better diagnostics for future CI issues

## Resolution
The issue was caused by SQLite database path generation using `Path.GetTempPath()` which had permission issues in the CI Ubuntu container environment. 

### Solution Implemented
1. Modified `TestDatabaseFactory.cs` to detect CI environment via `CI=true` environment variable
2. When running in CI, use current directory instead of temp path for database files
3. Added directory creation logic to ensure paths exist before creating database
4. Enhanced error logging and diagnostics in both the factory and workflow

### Files Modified
- `src/Infrastructure/Services/TestDatabaseFactory.cs` - Lines 33-44, 115-144
- `.github/workflows/pr-validation.yml` - Lines 284-299

## Verification
- [x] Tested PeopleController smoke test locally with CI=true environment variable - PASSED
- [x] Tested AuthController smoke test locally with CI=true environment variable - PASSED  
- [x] Tested both smoke tests together with CI=true environment variable - PASSED
- [x] Enhanced workflow diagnostics for better CI debugging
- [ ] Awaiting CI run to confirm fix works in GitHub Actions
