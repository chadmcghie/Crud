# Test Optimization Implementation Verification

## Summary

The test optimization strategy has been implemented as requested:

**feature branch → dev**: Build + Linting + Unit + lightweight integration  
**dev → staging**: Smoke + E2E against staging infrastructure  
**staging → main**: Short prod-safety gate only

## Implementation Details

### 1. Feature Branch Tests (`feature-branch-tests.yml`)
- **Trigger**: Push to `feature/**`, `bugfix/**`, `hotfix/**` branches
- **Tests Run**: Build + Lint + Unit tests only
- **Purpose**: Quick feedback for developers
- **Status**: ✅ Re-enabled and optimized

### 2. PR Validation (`pr-validation.yml`)
- **For PRs to `dev`**: Build + Lint + Unit + Integration tests (NO E2E)
- **For PRs to `main`**: Build + Lint + Unit + Integration + E2E Smoke tests
- **Logic**: `if: github.event.pull_request.base.ref == 'main'` for E2E tests
- **Status**: ✅ Implemented with conditional E2E testing

### 3. Staging Deployment (`deploy-staging.yml`)
- **Trigger**: Push to `dev` branch (after PR merge)
- **Tests Run**: Smoke tests only (`npm run test:smoke`)
- **Uses**: Pre-built artifacts from PR validation (no rebuild)
- **Status**: ✅ Already correctly implemented

### 4. Production Deployment (`deploy-production.yml`)
- **Trigger**: Push to `main` branch (after PR merge)
- **Tests Run**: Critical tests only (`npm run test:critical`) 
- **Purpose**: Final safety gate before production
- **Status**: ✅ Already correctly implemented

## Progressive Testing Flow

```
Feature Branch Push
├─ feature-branch-tests.yml (build + lint + unit)
│
└─ Create PR to dev
   ├─ pr-validation.yml (build + lint + unit + integration) [NO E2E]
   │
   └─ Merge to dev
      ├─ deploy-staging.yml (smoke E2E tests)
      │
      └─ Create PR to main  
         ├─ pr-validation.yml (build + lint + unit + integration + smoke E2E)
         │
         └─ Merge to main
            └─ deploy-production.yml (critical E2E tests)
```

## Verification

The issue has been resolved:
- ✅ Feature branches run lightweight tests only
- ✅ PRs to dev skip E2E tests (run during staging)
- ✅ PRs to main include E2E tests (production readiness)
- ✅ Staging deployment runs smoke E2E tests  
- ✅ Production deployment runs critical E2E tests only

This implements the exact test optimization strategy requested in the issue.
