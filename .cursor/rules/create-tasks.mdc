# Create Tasks

Create a tasks list with sub-tasks to execute a feature based on its spec.

## IMPORTANT: Check for Existing Issues First

Before creating any new GitHub issues:
1. Check the parent issue for already linked sub-issues
2. Search for existing issues that match the task scope
3. Use existing issues when available instead of creating duplicates
4. Only create new issues if no suitable existing issues are found

Refer to the instructions located in this file:
@.agent-os/instructions/core/create-tasks.md
