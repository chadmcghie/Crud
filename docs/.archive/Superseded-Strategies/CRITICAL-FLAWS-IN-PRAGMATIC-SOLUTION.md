# Critical Flaws in the "Pragmatic" Solution

## ðŸš¨ The Schema Prefix Approach is Actually Terrible

### 1. EF Core Will Fight You Every Step

#### Migration Nightmare
```csharp
// Your migrations are now broken
public partial class InitialCreate : Migration
{
    protected override void Up(MigrationBuilder migrationBuilder)
    {
        migrationBuilder.CreateTable(
            name: "People",  // Not "w0_People"!
            // ...
        );
    }
}

// EF expects "People" table
// You're giving it "w0_People"
// Result: Migration explosion ðŸ’¥
```

#### The DbContext Disaster
```csharp
protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
{
    // This runs at startup, not per-request!
    // Worker ID from HTTP header? NOT AVAILABLE!
    entityType.SetTableName($"{_tablePrefix}_{entityType.GetTableName()}");
}

// Reality: DbContext is singleton/scoped
// Can't change table names per request
// Would need new DbContext per worker = memory explosion
```

### 2. Foreign Key Apocalypse

```sql
-- Worker 0 tables
CREATE TABLE w0_People (Id, RoleId)
CREATE TABLE w0_Roles (Id)
FOREIGN KEY (RoleId) REFERENCES w0_Roles(Id) âœ…

-- Worker 1 creates a person with role from Worker 0?
INSERT INTO w1_People (RoleId) VALUES (1)
-- References w0_Roles? w1_Roles? Neither exists!
-- Constraint violation! ðŸ’¥
```

### 3. The HTTP Header Tracking Hell

```typescript
// Test code
await page.goto('http://localhost:4444');
// Browser makes request... where's the X-Worker-Id header?

// Angular makes API call
this.http.get('/api/people')
// Angular doesn't know about X-Worker-Id!

// Refresh the page
F5 â†’ Header lost â†’ Wrong schema â†’ Test fails!

// Open DevTools
Right-click â†’ Inspect â†’ New request without header â†’ ðŸ’¥
```

### 4. Static Resources Don't Have Headers

```typescript
// Angular loads
<script src="main.js"></script> // No header
<img src="assets/logo.png"> // No header
<link href="styles.css"> // No header

// Service Worker?
navigator.serviceWorker.register() // No header

// WebSocket connection?
new WebSocket('ws://localhost:5555') // No header support!

// Server-Sent Events?
new EventSource('/api/events') // No header!
```

### 5. Background Services are Completely Broken

```csharp
public class DataCleanupService : BackgroundService
{
    // This runs in background thread
    // No HTTP context!
    // Which worker's tables to clean?
    
    protected override async Task ExecuteAsync(CancellationToken token)
    {
        await _context.People.DeleteAll(); // Which People table?!
        // Deletes from wrong schema or crashes
    }
}
```

### 6. Third-Party Integrations Explode

```csharp
// Hangfire/Quartz job
RecurringJob.AddOrUpdate(() => ProcessOrders());
// No HTTP context, no worker ID!

// SignalR Hub
public override async Task OnConnectedAsync()
{
    await Clients.All.SendAsync("UserJoined");
    // Which schema for user data?
}

// Health checks
app.MapHealthChecks("/health");
// Health check has no worker context!
```

### 7. Database Integrity is Destroyed

```sql
-- You now have:
w0_People: [Alice, Bob]
w1_People: [Charlie, David]
w2_People: [Eve, Frank]

-- Business question: "How many users do we have?"
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM People; -- Table doesn't exist!
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM w0_People; -- Wrong, only partial data

-- Need reports?
SELECT * FROM w0_People 
UNION SELECT * FROM w1_People
UNION SELECT * FROM w2_People
UNION... -- How many workers again?
```

### 8. The Debugging Impossibility

```bash
# Developer: "Test failing, let me check the DB"
sqlite3 TestDb.db
> .tables
w0_People w0_Roles w1_People w1_Roles w2_People w2_Roles w3_People...

> SELECT * FROM People;
Error: no such table: People

> SELECT * FROM w2_People;
-- Is this the right worker? Which test was worker 2?
-- Was it the failing test or different one?
```

### 9. Cookie/Session Management Breaks

```typescript
// Angular sets auth cookie
document.cookie = "auth=token123";

// Next request needs both:
// - Auth cookie (works)
// - X-Worker-Id header (lost on navigation!)

// User clicks link
<a href="/dashboard">Dashboard</a>
// Browser navigates, header gone, wrong schema!
```

### 10. The Shared Server Bottleneck

```
Worker 0: INSERT INTO w0_People (100 records)
Worker 1: INSERT INTO w1_People (100 records)
Worker 2: DELETE FROM w2_People
Worker 3: UPDATE w3_Roles

Same SQLite file = LOCKED!
Worker 1: Waiting...
Worker 2: Timeout!
Worker 3: Deadlock!
```

### 11. Schema Creation Race Condition

```typescript
// All workers start simultaneously
Worker 0: CREATE TABLE w0_People... 
Worker 1: CREATE TABLE w1_People...
Worker 2: CREATE TABLE w2_People...
Worker 3: CREATE TABLE w3_People...

// SQLite file locked by Worker 0
Worker 1,2,3: DATABASE IS LOCKED error
Tests fail before they even start!
```

### 12. The "Simple" 4-Hour Implementation

**Reality: 4 Weeks**

- Week 1: Fighting EF Core to accept dynamic table names
- Week 2: Rewriting every API call to pass headers
- Week 3: Debugging why schemas randomly disappear  
- Week 4: Giving up and going back to single worker

## What I Completely Ignored

### Angular's Reality
```typescript
// Angular's HTTP interceptor would need
export class WorkerIdInterceptor {
  intercept(req: HttpRequest<any>): Observable<HttpEvent<any>> {
    // But where does workerId come from?
    // Window.workerId? localStorage? sessionStorage?
    // How does Playwright set it?
    // What about lazy-loaded modules?
  }
}
```

### SQLite's Single-Writer Limitation
```
SQLite allows:
- Multiple readers OR
- One writer

4 workers writing = 3 waiting = timeout city
```

### The Test Rewrite Burden
```typescript
// Every single test needs updating
test('create user', async ({ page, workerContext }) => {
  // Must use workerContext, not page
  // Must never use page.goto directly
  // Must track worker ID manually
  // 300+ tests to rewrite!
});
```

## The Brutal Reality

This "pragmatic" solution requires:

1. **Forking EF Core** to support dynamic schemas
2. **Rewriting Angular's HTTP layer** 
3. **Modifying every test** to pass headers
4. **Accepting SQLite lock contentions**
5. **Breaking all background services**
6. **Making debugging impossible**
7. **Destroying data integrity**

## What Would Actually Happen

```
Day 1: "Let's add table prefixes!"
Day 2: EF Core migrations don't work
Day 3: Research EF Core interceptors
Day 4: Headers don't propagate through Angular
Day 5: Add HTTP interceptor
Day 6: Static resources break
Day 7: Background service crashes
Week 2: "Maybe we should just use Docker..."
Week 3: "Or maybe just run tests serially..."
Week 4: "Actually, let's just not test everything..."
```

## The Honest Truth

**There is no magic solution that:**
- Uses shared servers
- Provides perfect isolation  
- Works with EF Core + SQLite
- Requires no major rewrites
- Takes 4 hours to implement

**Every approach has massive trade-offs:**
- **Speed?** Give up isolation
- **Isolation?** Give up shared servers
- **Shared servers?** Give up parallel execution
- **All three?** Rewrite everything or use different tech

## The Real Problem

We keep trying to make a **monolithic architecture** behave like a **microservice architecture** for testing. It's fundamentally the wrong approach.

The actual solution might be:
1. **Accept the limitation**: Run tests serially
2. **Change the architecture**: Make services stateless
3. **Change the tech**: Use Postgres/SQL Server with better isolation
4. **Change the tests**: Test less E2E, more unit/integration

But there's no 4-hour fix that magically solves this.
