# Integration Tests Failing After Authorization and Middleware Changes

## Problem Statement
Backend integration tests are failing after implementing controller authorization and adding ConditionalRequestMiddleware. Multiple test categories are affected including compression tests, authentication tests, and CRUD operation tests. The tests expect successful HTTP responses but are receiving failures due to authorization requirements and middleware conflicts.

## Symptoms
- Compression tests failing with `Expected response.IsSuccessStatusCode to be true, but found False`
- Authentication validation errors: `Invalid email format` for test user emails
- KeyNotFoundException: `Person {guid} not found` in PUT operations
- Tests that previously passed are now failing after authorization implementation
- Occurs consistently in CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions)
- Environment: SQLite integration tests in Linux containers

## Impact
- Blocks completion of controller authorization feature implementation
- Prevents PR merge to main branch
- Affects 15+ integration test classes
- Delays feature delivery and deployment pipeline
- Compromises confidence in authorization implementation

## Root Cause Analysis (Five Whys)
1. Why are integration tests failing after authorization implementation?
   Answer: Tests are not properly authenticated for endpoints that now require authorization

2. Why are tests not properly authenticated?
   Answer: Some test methods don't use authenticated HTTP clients for requests to protected endpoints

3. Why don't all test methods use authenticated clients?
   Answer: The authorization requirements were added to controllers after tests were written, and not all tests were updated

4. Why weren't all tests updated when authorization was added?
   Answer: The authorization changes were merged from dev branch during conflict resolution, creating a mismatch

5. Why did the merge create authentication mismatches?
   Answer: Two parallel features (authorization and output caching) were developed simultaneously without coordinated test strategy (ROOT CAUSE)

## Attempted Solutions

### Attempt 1: [2025-09-11 02:30]
**Approach**: Updated output caching tests to use authenticated clients
**Result**: Partially successful - fixed authorization-related failures in caching tests
**Files Modified**: 
- test/Tests.Integration.Backend/OutputCaching/OutputCachingTests.cs
- test/Tests.Integration.Backend/OutputCaching/ConditionalRequestTests.cs
- test/Tests.Integration.Backend/OutputCaching/CachingE2ETests.cs
- test/Tests.Integration.Backend/OutputCaching/CacheInvalidationTests.cs
**Key Learning**: Authorization fixes work but revealed additional middleware conflicts

### Attempt 2: [2025-09-11 02:45]
**Approach**: Added ConditionalRequestMiddleware to handle ETag/304 responses properly
**Result**: Fixed conditional request logic but introduced new middleware ordering issues
**Files Modified**:
- src/Api/Middleware/ConditionalRequestMiddleware.cs
- src/Api/Program.cs
**Key Learning**: Middleware order is critical - conditional requests must run before output caching

### Attempt 3: [2025-09-11 02:50]
**Approach**: Fixed database constraint violations with unique test data generation
**Result**: Resolved SQLite unique constraint errors but compression tests still failing
**Files Modified**:
- test/Tests.Integration.Backend/Infrastructure/TestDataBuilders.cs
- test/Tests.Integration.Backend/Controllers/ApiHealthTests.cs
**Key Learning**: Test data isolation is crucial for parallel execution, but authorization issues remain in other test categories

## Strategic Changes (DO NOT ROLLBACK)
List of improvements made during troubleshooting that must be preserved:
- [x] File: test/Tests.Integration.Backend/OutputCaching/*.cs - Lines: Various - Change: Added authenticated HTTP clients - Reason: Required for authorization compliance
- [x] File: src/Api/Middleware/ConditionalRequestMiddleware.cs - Lines: 1-130 - Change: New middleware for ETag handling - Reason: Proper conditional request support with output caching
- [x] File: src/Api/Program.cs - Lines: 397-398 - Change: Added ConditionalRequestMiddleware before output caching - Reason: Correct middleware pipeline order
- [x] File: test/Tests.Integration.Backend/Infrastructure/TestDataBuilders.cs - Lines: 15-23 - Change: Unique role name generation - Reason: Prevents SQLite constraint violations in parallel tests
- [x] File: test/Tests.Integration.Backend/Controllers/ApiHealthTests.cs - Lines: 146, 121 - Change: Unique test role names - Reason: Eliminates race conditions in concurrent tests

## Current Workaround
None available - tests must pass for feature completion and PR merge.

## Next Steps
- [ ] Investigate compression test failures - likely need authenticated clients for /api/people endpoints
- [ ] Review all integration test classes for missing authentication requirements
- [ ] Update AuthenticationTestHelper to handle email validation issues in CI environment
- [ ] Consider creating test-specific authentication bypass for compression/performance tests
- [ ] Verify middleware pipeline order doesn't conflict with compression middleware
- [ ] Run tests locally to isolate CI-specific vs general authorization issues
