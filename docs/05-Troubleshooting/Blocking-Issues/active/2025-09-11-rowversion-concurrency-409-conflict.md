# RowVersion Concurrency Control 409 Conflict Issue

## Problem Statement
PUT_People_Should_Update_Person_Roles test consistently fails with 409 Conflict after implementing complete RowVersion concurrency control infrastructure. The test was originally skipped with message "Skipping due to concurrency conflict - RowVersion not implemented in UpdatePersonRequest" but now fails even though all required infrastructure has been implemented correctly.

## Symptoms
- Test fails with HTTP 409 Conflict status code instead of expected 204 No Content
- Error: "Expected response.StatusCode to be HttpStatusCode.NoContent {value: 204}, but found HttpStatusCode.Conflict {value: 409}"
- Test builds successfully and is no longer skipped
- Issue occurs both locally and in CI environments
- All other Person entity operations (create, get, delete) work correctly

## Impact
- RowVersion concurrency control implementation cannot be completed and validated
- Integration test remains failing, blocking CI pipeline completion
- Concurrency protection for Person entity updates not properly functional
- Person role assignment updates are blocked due to failing validation

## Root Cause Analysis (Five Whys)

1. **Why does the PUT_People_Should_Update_Person_Roles test fail with 409 Conflict?**
   Answer: GlobalExceptionHandlingMiddleware converts InvalidOperationException (from repository) to HTTP 409 status

2. **Why does the repository throw InvalidOperationException?**
   Answer: EfPersonRepository catches DbUpdateConcurrencyException and re-throws as InvalidOperationException

3. **Why does Entity Framework throw DbUpdateConcurrencyException?**
   Answer: EF Core detects concurrency conflicts when updating Person entities with role changes

4. **Why does EF Core detect concurrency conflicts when PersonConfiguration has .IsConcurrencyToken() disabled?**
   Answer: RowVersion property exists on Person entity and EF may still be performing concurrency checks based on entity state tracking

5. **Why does entity state tracking cause concurrency conflicts even with disabled concurrency token?**
   Answer: The UpdateAsync method uses _context.People.Update() which marks the entire entity as modified, potentially triggering RowVersion validation regardless of configuration (ROOT CAUSE)

## Attempted Solutions

### Attempt 1: [2025-09-11 05:00]
**Approach**: Pass null RowVersion in test request to bypass concurrency checks
**Result**: Test still fails with 409 Conflict
**Files Modified**: 
- test/Tests.Integration.Backend/Controllers/PeopleControllerTests.cs (line 269)
**Key Learning**: Null RowVersion doesn't prevent EF from detecting concurrency conflicts

### Attempt 2: [2025-09-11 05:30]
**Approach**: Fetch current RowVersion from GET request and pass to PUT request
**Result**: Test still fails with 409 Conflict - Entity Framework still detects conflicts
**Files Modified**:
- test/Tests.Integration.Backend/Controllers/PeopleControllerTests.cs (lines 264-266, 269)
**Key Learning**: Even with correct RowVersion, EF Core entity tracking causes conflicts during role updates

### Attempt 3: [2025-09-11 06:00]
**Approach**: Completely disable .IsConcurrencyToken() in PersonConfiguration
**Result**: Test still fails with 409 Conflict - disabled token doesn't resolve Update() method conflicts
**Files Modified**:
- src/Infrastructure/Data/Configurations/PersonConfiguration.cs (line 25 - commented out .IsConcurrencyToken())
**Key Learning**: Disabling concurrency token in configuration doesn't fix Update() method entity tracking conflicts

## Strategic Changes (DO NOT ROLLBACK)
List of improvements made during troubleshooting that must be preserved:
- [x] File: src/Api/Dtos/PeopleDtos.cs - Lines: 11-16 - Change: Added RowVersion parameter to UpdatePersonRequest - Reason: Foundation for proper concurrency control implementation
- [x] File: src/Api/Dtos/PeopleDtos.cs - Lines: 18 - Change: Added RowVersion to PersonResponse - Reason: Clients need RowVersion for optimistic concurrency control
- [x] File: src/App/Features/People/Commands.cs - Lines: 12-18 - Change: Added RowVersion parameter to UpdatePersonCommand - Reason: Command layer must support concurrency control
- [x] File: src/Api/Controllers/PeopleController.cs - Lines: 85 - Change: Pass RowVersion from request to command - Reason: Controller must forward concurrency token
- [x] File: test/Tests.Integration.Backend/Infrastructure/TestDataBuilders.cs - Lines: 49-61 - Change: Added RowVersion parameter to UpdatePersonRequest builder - Reason: Test infrastructure must support concurrency control testing
- [x] File: src/Domain/Entities/Person.cs - Lines: 29-31 - Change: Added RowVersion property with proper documentation - Reason: Domain entity needs concurrency control foundation

## Current Workaround
Remove RowVersion entirely from UpdatePersonRequest, command, and entity - test passes but defeats the purpose of implementing concurrency control.

## Next Steps
- [ ] Investigate if EfPersonRepository.UpdateAsync should use different EF tracking approach (Attach vs Update)
- [ ] Consider implementing explicit concurrency checking in command handler instead of relying on EF automatic detection
- [ ] Explore if PersonRole many-to-many relationship changes trigger additional concurrency conflicts
- [ ] Test if issue is specific to role updates vs simple property updates
- [ ] Examine if SaveChangesWithRetryAsync interferes with concurrency control logic
