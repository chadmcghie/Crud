## Clean Architecture Violations

## Summary

**MAJOR ARCHITECTURAL ACHIEVEMENTS**: The solution has achieved significant architectural improvements with most critical patterns now properly implemented:

✅ **Recently Resolved Issues:**
- **CQRS Implementation**: Full MediatR pattern with commands, queries, and handlers
- **Validation**: Comprehensive FluentValidation at all layers
- **Mapping**: AutoMapper profiles for clean DTO mapping
- **Logging**: Serilog + OpenTelemetry observability stack
- **Error Handling**: Global exception handling middleware
- **Resilience**: Polly policies for HTTP and database operations
- **Domain Layer**: GuardClauses implementation with proper invariant enforcement
- **CI/CD**: Automated pipeline with security scanning and dependency updates

**Remaining Critical Issues:**
1. **Authentication & Authorization**: Critical security gap - all endpoints public
2. **Database Migration Strategy**: Using EnsureCreatedAsync instead of MigrateAsync
3. **Advanced Domain Patterns**: Missing BaseEntity, IAggregateRoot, and complex specifications

## Priority Recommendations

**Critical Priority (Security & Production Readiness):**
- Implement Authentication & Authorization (JWT bearer authentication, authorization policies)
- Switch to MigrateAsync for production database migration strategy

**High Priority (Advanced Patterns):**
- Implement IAggregateRoot interface and BaseEntity pattern
- Implement complex Ardalis.Specification patterns for query logic encapsulation
- Add generic IRepository<T> pattern for better abstraction

**Medium Priority (Performance & Features):**
- Implement caching layer (Redis/LazyCache) for performance optimization
- Add GraphQL endpoints with HotChocolate (if needed)
- Implement multi-tenancy with Finbuckle.MultiTenant (if required)
- Add security scanning (OWASP ZAP, DevSkim)

**Low Priority (Nice to Have):**
- Add Scrutor decorators for cross-cutting concerns
- Implement Testcontainers for more realistic integration testing
- Add AI PR review integration (CodeRabbit, CodiumAI)
