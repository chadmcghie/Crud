# Should You Build an Opinionated CRUD Template?

Having a **well-structured, opinionated CRUD template** is one of the most pragmatic things you can do as a developer. Think of it like owning a good set of power tools: it doesn’t finish the house for you, but it makes every build faster, cleaner, and more consistent.

---

## ✅ Why a CRUD Template Helps
- **Jumpstart Projects** – spin up basic entities, controllers, and persistence in minutes  
- **Consistency** – common patterns (naming, error handling, auth, logging) are standardized  
- **Reduced Boilerplate** – stop rewriting the same Create/Read/Update/Delete flows  
- **Faster Onboarding** – new team members understand the conventions immediately  
- **Scaffolding for Growth** – lets you focus on domain rules, integrations, and workflows

## 🛠️ What to Include
A good template should cover more than just endpoints:

- **Entity & Repository Layer** – abstractions over persistence (SQL, NoSQL, etc.)  
- **REST/GraphQL APIs** – standardized controllers with consistent routes and error codes  
- **Validation & DTOs** – input validation and mapping baked in  
- **Auth & RBAC hooks** – starter policies for permissions and ownership checks  
- **Unit Test Harness** – base test setup for entities, controllers, and DB  
- **Logging & Observability** – structured logs, request IDs, metrics stubs  
- **CI/CD scaffolding** – lint/test pipelines so you never skip them later  

---

## ⚠️ The Caveat: CRUD ≠ Finished Product
The trap is stopping at CRUD. Many failed projects are “just a database with a UI.”  
A template helps with the **plumbing**, but the **real value** comes when you add:

- **Domain logic** (rules, workflows)  
- **Great UX** (user-focused design)  
- **External integrations** (APIs, queues, events)  

---

## 🔑 Bottom Line
Building your own **opinionated CRUD starter kit** is a **high ROI investment**.  
It takes care of the repeatable 80%, so you can spend your time on the 20% that makes each project unique.
