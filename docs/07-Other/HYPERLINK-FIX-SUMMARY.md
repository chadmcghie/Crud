# Hyperlink Fix Summary

## Date: September 10, 2025

This document summarizes the hyperlink fixes applied across all documentation files to match the current directory structure.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Fixed References to Reorganized Directories

#### Old Structure → New Structure
- `05-Quality Control/Testing/` → `02-Architecture/Quality-Assurance/`
- `04-Project Management/` → `03-Development/`
- `QualityControl/` → `04-Quality-Control/`
- `Architecture/Testing/` → `02-Architecture/Quality-Assurance/`
- `Misc/` → Various appropriate locations

### 2. Updated Agent OS References

All references to `.agent-os/` were updated to use the correct path:
- `.agent-os/` → `.agents/.agent-os/` (for agent tools and instructions)
- `.agent-os/specs/` → `docs/03-Development/specs/` (for specifications)
- `.agent-os/blocking-issues/` → `docs/05-Troubleshooting/Blocking-Issues/`
- `.agent-os/recaps/` → `docs/03-Development/recaps/`
- `.agent-os/status/` → `docs/03-Development/status/`
- `.agent-os/learning/` → `docs/03-Development/learning/`

### 3. Fixed Architecture Decision Record References

- `ADR-001-Serial-E2E-Testing.md` → `0001-Serial-E2E-Testing.md`
- Updated all paths to point to `02-Architecture/Decisions/`

### 4. Updated Spec Cross-References

All spec files now use relative markdown links instead of `@.agent-os/specs/` references:
- `@.agent-os/specs/[spec-name]/spec.md` → `[spec.md](../spec.md)` or `[spec.md](./spec.md)`

### 5. Removed Absolute Paths

Replaced all absolute paths with relative paths:
- `C:\Users\chadm\source\repos\Crud\` → Relative paths from project root

- `docs/05-Troubleshooting/Blocking-Issues/resolved/` - Multiple files

### Archive Files
- `docs/06-Archive/deprecated-features-cleanup-20250905.md`
- `docs/06-Archive/claude-task-e2e-test-troubleshooting-20250831.md`

## Environment Variables

While no environment variables were explicitly added in this update, the documentation now uses relative paths that are portable across different environments. The workspace root is implicitly understood as the base for all relative paths.

## Verification

All hyperlinks have been updated to:
1. Use the correct numbered directory structure (01-06)
2. Reference files that actually exist in the repository
3. Use relative paths for portability
4. Maintain consistency with the reorganized documentation structure

## Next Steps

1. Consider adding a link checker to CI/CD pipeline to catch broken links automatically
2. Establish documentation standards for future hyperlink creation
3. Document the use of environment variables if needed for specific deployment scenarios
