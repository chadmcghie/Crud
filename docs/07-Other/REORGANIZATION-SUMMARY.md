# Docs Reorganization Summary

## ✅ Completed Reorganization

The docs folder has been successfully reorganized into a logical, numbered structure that separates concerns and improves navigation.

### 🔄 Key Changes Made

#### **1. Logical Separation**
- **Architecture**: System design and testing strategy decisions
- **Development**: Project management, specs, and workflows
- **Quality Control**: Review processes (not architectural decisions)
- **Troubleshooting**: Problem resolution and blocking issues

#### **2. Renamed for Clarity**
- `Testing/` → `Quality-Assurance/` (architectural decisions about testing)
- `Development/` → `03-Development/` (numbered for navigation)
- `QualityControl/` → `04-Quality-Control/` (numbered for navigation)

#### **3. Moved Content Appropriately**
- **Blocking Issues**: Moved from Development to Troubleshooting (where they belong)
- **Testing Strategy**: Moved from Quality Control to Architecture (architectural decisions)
- **Troubleshooting Guides**: Consolidated in Troubleshooting section

#### **4. Updated All References**
- ✅ Agent configurations updated to new paths
- ✅ Cursor rules updated to new paths  
- ✅ Agent OS instructions updated to new paths
- ✅ Tool scripts updated to new paths

### 🎯 Benefits

1. **Clear Navigation**: Numbered folders provide logical flow
2. **Proper Separation**: Architecture vs Process vs Problem-solving
3. **Agent Integration**: All tools now output to appropriate folders
4. **Maintainability**: Easier to find and update content
5. **Scalability**: Room for growth in each category

### 🛠️ Agent Tool Integration

#### **New Output Paths for Agents:**
- **Testing strategy decisions** → `docs/02-Architecture/Quality-Assurance/`
- **Review results** → `docs/04-Quality-Control/[Code|Architecture|Design]-Review/`
- **Blocking issues** → `docs/05-Troubleshooting/Blocking-Issues/`
- **Development recaps** → `docs/03-Development/Recaps/`
- **Development specs** → `docs/03-Development/Specs/`

#### **Agent Tools Remain Separate:**
- **`.agents/.agent-os/`** → Agent OS tools and instructions (unchanged)
- **`.agents/.tools/`** → Custom tool scripts (unchanged)

### ✅ Verification

All agent workflows have been updated to use the new documentation structure while keeping agent tools in their proper locations. The reorganization maintains the separation between:
- **Agent tools** (in `.agents/`)
- **Documentation** (in `docs/`)
- **Agent outputs** (to appropriate `docs/` folders)

The system is ready for use with the new organization! 🚀
