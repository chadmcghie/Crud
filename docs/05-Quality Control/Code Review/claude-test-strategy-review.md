● Based on my analysis of your E2E testing strategy, I can identify several critical issues and provide a roadmap to achieve
  100% test reliability. Here are the key findings:

  Current Issues Identified

  1. Fundamental Architecture Problem: Your current implementation has a major disconnect between design intent and actual
  implementation:
  - Design: Finbuckle + SQLite + EF Core for multi-tenant database isolation per worker
  - Reality: Single shared database with manual cleanup using EF Core RemoveRange() operations

  2. Database Isolation Failures:
  - Your DatabaseTestService.cs:47-72 does basic cleanup via RemoveRange(), not true isolation
  - No actual multi-tenant database implementation found in the codebase
  - Tests share the same database instance, causing race conditions

  3. Respawn Alternative Issues:
  - Your homegrown cleanup in DatabaseTestService doesn't handle foreign key constraints properly
  - Order of cleanup operations matters but isn't guaranteed to be correct for all scenarios

● Respawn Alternatives for SQLite

  Problem: Respawn doesn't fully support SQLite, but there are better alternatives than your current EF Core cleanup:

  Alternative 1 - SQLite-Compatible Respawn Fork:
  - Use Respawn.Sqlite NuGet package (community-maintained fork)
  - Handles foreign key constraints properly
  - More reliable than manual cleanup

  Alternative 2 - Database Recreation Strategy:
  - Drop and recreate the SQLite database file for each test
  - Most reliable isolation but slower performance

  Alternative 3 - Transaction Rollback:
  - Wrap each test in a transaction and rollback
  - Fast but requires careful transaction management

● Roadmap to 100% Test Reliability

  Phase 1: Immediate Fixes (High Impact, Low Effort)

  Timeline: 1-2 days

  1. Fix Database Cleanup Order - DatabaseTestService.cs:56-61
    - Reverse deletion order: People → Roles → Windows → Walls
    - Add proper foreign key constraint handling
    - Add transaction wrapper for atomicity
  2. Implement True Worker Database Isolation - Program.cs:64-80
    - Create separate SQLite files per worker: test_worker_{workerIndex}_{timestamp}.db
    - Ensure each worker gets a completely isolated database instance
  3. Add Database Lock Management
    - Implement file locking to prevent database conflicts
    - Add retry logic for database creation/deletion operations

  Phase 2: Architecture Improvements (Medium Effort)

  Timeline: 3-5 days

  1. Implement Proper Multi-Tenant Database Strategy
    - Create TestDatabaseFactory that generates isolated databases per worker
    - Use in-memory SQLite for faster test execution
    - Implement proper cleanup of database files after test completion
  2. Replace Manual Cleanup with Respawn.Sqlite
    - Install Respawn.Sqlite package
    - Replace DatabaseTestService cleanup logic with Respawn
    - Handle schema preservation properly
  3. Add Database State Validation
    - Implement pre-test and post-test database state checks
    - Add logging for database operations to aid debugging
    - Create database integrity verification

  Phase 3: Reliability Enhancements (Lower Priority)

  Timeline: 1-2 days

  1. Implement Test Retry Strategy
    - Add intelligent retry logic for database-related failures
    - Implement exponential backoff for database conflicts
  2. Add Comprehensive Test Monitoring
    - Implement test execution metrics
    - Add database performance monitoring
    - Create failure pattern analysis

  Recommended Immediate Actions

  1. Stop using the current cleanup approach - it's fundamentally flawed for concurrent testing
  2. Implement true database isolation using separate SQLite files per worker
  3. Use Respawn.Sqlite package instead of manual EF Core cleanup
  4. Add proper error handling and retry mechanisms for database operations

  This approach should get you from ~10% failure rate to 0% failure rate by addressing the root cause: inadequate database
  isolation in concurrent test environments.
