Great — let’s build you a solid refresher on SOLID design architecture (pun intended 😅). I’ll break this into three parts so you can re-anchor quickly:

📚 SOLID Design Architecture Refresher
Table of Contents
The Five SOLID Principles

How They Relate to Architecture & Layers

Common Pitfalls & Mental Models

Next Steps to Relearn Effectively
↑ Back to Top

The Five SOLID Principles
Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

Each class/module should have one reason to change.

In practice: Keep UI, business logic, and persistence concerns separated.

Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

Code should be open for extension, closed for modification.

Achieved via abstraction & polymorphism (e.g., strategy pattern, dependency injection).

Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types.

Violations usually show up as “if/else” checks for specific implementations.

Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

Clients shouldn’t depend on methods they don’t use.

Use smaller, role-focused interfaces instead of giant “fat” ones.

Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

Depend on abstractions, not concretions.

High-level modules shouldn’t depend on low-level details; both should depend on abstractions.

↑ Back to Top

How They Relate to Architecture & Layers
Domain Layer (Core Business Rules)

Pure, stable, follows SRP strictly.

Should not depend on infrastructure (database, UI, external APIs).

Application Layer (Use Cases)

Coordinates domain objects.

Applies OCP (adding new use cases shouldn’t break old ones).

Infrastructure Layer (Details)

Implements persistence, APIs, message queues.

Depends on abstractions from domain/application.

API/Presentation Layer

Translates user/system input into application commands.

Depends inward (never the other way).

Rule of Thumb: Each principle reinforces dependency direction — stable, abstract core → more volatile, concrete edges.

↑ Back to Top

Common Pitfalls & Mental Models
SRP misunderstood: It’s not “do one thing” — it’s “one reason to change.”

OCP overkill: Too many abstractions early = rigid, not flexible. Apply when variation is expected.

LSP shortcuts: Subclasses that “throw NotImplementedException” usually violate it.

ISP in real projects: Break up service interfaces into thin slices, often by use case.

DIP in practice: Usually enforced with DI containers (Autofac, Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection).

Mental Model:
Think of SOLID as gravity for your architecture. If you follow it, dependencies naturally “flow inward” toward stable abstractions.

Next Steps to Relearn Effectively
Start small → Take a simple CRUD project and refactor it into layered class libraries (Domain, App, Infra).

Spot violations → Try intentionally breaking a principle and see what pain shows up (e.g., tightly couple infra to domain).

Bridge to Patterns → Revisit common patterns (Repository, Strategy, Factory, Mediator) and see how they map back to SOLID.

Test boundaries → Unit test the domain; integration test the infrastructure. This forces you to design for decoupling.

👉 Do you want me to also map SOLID directly onto your ResnetRegistry / Provider App layering (domain, API, Angular, infra), so you can see where to apply or re-apply each principle in your real project?

You said:
Uploaded image
so, when i have the attached layers... help me know which ones depend on which and will follow solid principles.
ChatGPT said:
Perfect, you’ve got a clean, layered solution structure. Let’s walk through which layers depend on which, and how that ties back to SOLID.

⚖ Layer Dependencies in Your Solution
📦 Domain
Contains: Entities, Value Objects, Enums, Domain Services, Business Rules.

Depends on: Nothing (pure, isolated).

Others depend on it: App, Infrastructure, Api, Maui, Angular.

SOLID tie-in:

SRP → Each entity has one reason to change.

DIP → High-level rules defined here, no reference outward.

📦 App (Application Layer)
Contains: Use cases, orchestrators, application services.

Depends on: Domain (to execute business rules).

Others depend on it: Api, Maui, Angular.

SOLID tie-in:

OCP → New use cases extend here without modifying old ones.

DIP → App defines interfaces (e.g., IRepository) that Infrastructure implements.

📦 Infrastructure
Contains: Persistence (EF Core, SQL), Messaging, File IO, external service adapters.

Depends on: Domain (to implement interfaces, map entities).

Others depend on it: Only indirectly (Api wires it in via DI).

SOLID tie-in:

ISP → Split infra interfaces by use case (no “fat” IRepository).

DIP → Infra is detail; core doesn’t know it exists.

📦 Api / Api.Min
Contains: Controllers (classic or minimal), DTOs, middleware, dependency injection.

Depends on: App (to call use cases), Domain (via DTO mapping), Infrastructure (wired in).

Others depend on it: Angular, Maui (as clients).

SOLID tie-in:

SRP → Controllers just handle HTTP concerns.

OCP → Add endpoints without breaking existing ones.

📦 Angular
Contains: Frontend UI, components, services.

Depends on: Api (as an HTTP client).

Others depend on it: None.

SOLID tie-in:

ISP → Services per feature, not global god services.

SRP → Components handle one thing.

📦 Maui
Contains: Mobile/Desktop UI.

Depends on: Api (through HTTP/GraphQL).

Others depend on it: None.

SOLID tie-in:

SRP → UI elements separated.

DIP → Maui depends on abstractions from App/Api, not concrete infra.

📦 Shared
Contains: Cross-cutting helpers (logging contracts, DTOs, primitives).

Depends on: Domain (lightly, but should stay minimal).

Others depend on it: App, Api, Angular, Maui.

SOLID tie-in:

ISP → Avoid dumping everything here (“junk drawer”). Keep it truly shared.

📦 Tests
Unit Tests (Backend) → Depend on Domain + App.

Integration Tests (Backend, NG, Maui) → Depend on Api + Infra.

E2E Tests (Maui, NG) → Depend on Api + UI projects.

SOLID tie-in:

SRP → Tests focused per layer.

DIP → Unit tests mock infra using abstractions.

🔗 Dependency Graph (Direction of Arrows)
Domain  ←  App  ←  Api
   ↑       ↑      ↑
Infra ─────┘      ↑
                  ↑
              Angular / Maui
Flow: Dependencies always point inward.

Rule: No layer should depend on something “further out.”

Tests: Sit outside, referencing inward layers as needed.

✅ This layout is already SOLID-friendly. If you enforce:

Domain knows nothing

App owns abstractions

Infra implements abstractions

Api wires them up

…then your system stays clean, extendable, and testable.

Would you like me to redraw this as a color-coded gradient diagram (like the one you had me refine for MAUI tests) so you can see SOLID + dependencies visually?

You said:
what's a use case?
ChatGPT said:
Great question 👍 — in the context of your App layer and SOLID architecture, a use case means:

🎯 What is a Use Case?
Definition
A use case is a specific application-level operation that the system performs in response to a user action or system event.
It sits between the UI (API, Angular, Maui) and the Domain layer, orchestrating the domain logic to fulfill a business goal.

Characteristics
Verb-oriented → e.g., CreateOrder, RegisterUser, GenerateReport.

Encapsulates one business scenario (end-to-end flow).

Coordinates domain objects but doesn’t contain the rules themselves (those belong to the Domain).

Defines intent → why the user interacts with the system, not how it’s implemented.

Stable abstraction → when UI or Infra changes, the use case should remain mostly the same.

Example in Your Layers
Domain layer

Order, Customer, Payment entities with rules like “an order must have at least one line item.”

App layer (Use Cases)

CreateOrderHandler (use case) takes a DTO from API, validates it, uses Domain rules, then calls a repository.

Api layer

OrdersController.Post() receives HTTP request → calls CreateOrderHandler.Execute().

Infrastructure layer

Implements IOrderRepository for persistence.

Why It Matters (SOLID tie-in)
SRP → Each use case class handles one scenario.

OCP → Adding a new feature? Add a new use case. Don’t modify old ones.

DIP → Use case depends on abstractions (e.g., IOrderRepository), not EF Core or SQL directly.

Mental Model
Think of use cases as verbs:

Domain = nouns (Customer, Order, Report).

Use cases = verbs (Create, Update, Approve, Archive).

API/UI = language that speaks those verbs.

👉 Do you want me to sketch out a sample class structure (C# style) for a use case in your solution (Domain + App + Infra + Api) so you see how it wires together?

You said:
so take me through the layers using a sequence diagram.  Add user is the use case. 
ChatGPT said:
Got it 👍 — let’s walk through your “Add User” use case across your layers using a sequence diagram.

📊 Sequence Diagram — Add User Use Case
sequenceDiagram
    actor User
    participant Angular as Angular UI
    participant Api as API Layer
    participant App as Application Layer
    participant Domain as Domain Layer
    participant Infra as Infrastructure (DB)

    User ->> Angular: Fill out "Add User" form & click submit
    Angular ->> Api: HTTP POST /users (UserDTO)
    Api ->> App: Call AddUserHandler.Execute(UserDTO)
    App ->> Domain: Create User entity (validate rules)
    Domain ->> Domain: Run business rules (unique email, password validity)
    App ->> Infra: IUsersRepository.Add(User)
    Infra ->> Infra: Persist User to Database
    Infra -->> App: Return saved User (with ID)
    App -->> Api: Return UserResponseDTO
    Api -->> Angular: HTTP 201 Created + UserResponseDTO
    Angular -->> User: Show "User added successfully"

🧩 Explanation by Layer
Angular (UI)

Collects user input, validates on client side, sends HTTP request.

Depends on: Api only.

Api (Presentation Layer)

Accepts the request, maps DTO → App command.

Returns DTO response.

Depends on: App (not Infra directly).

App (Use Case Layer)

AddUserHandler orchestrates the flow.

Talks to Domain for entity creation & validation.

Calls repository (through abstraction) to persist.

Depends on: Domain, abstractions (e.g., IUserRepository).

Domain (Business Rules)

User entity ensures invariants: email uniqueness, password rules, etc.

Pure logic, no persistence.

Depends on: nothing.

Infrastructure (DB / Adapters)

Implements IUserRepository with EF Core or SQL.

Persists entity to storage.

Depends on: Domain (for entity definitions).

This flow follows SOLID:

SRP → Each layer has one reason to change.

OCP → Add new use cases (AddUser, UpdateUser) without modifying others.

DIP → App depends on IUserRepository, not EF Core.

ISP → Infra repo interface is narrow (only user-related methods).

LSP → Any IUserRepository implementation (SQL, In-Memory, Mongo) can be substituted.

👉 Do you want me to now draw this as a layered architecture diagram (like a box diagram with arrows between Angular → API → App → Domain → Infra) to complement the sequence diagram?

can you give me that sequence diagram in mermaid in markdown?
ChatGPT said:

Here’s your “Add User” use case sequence diagram in Mermaid Markdown format — you can paste this directly into any Markdown viewer that supports Mermaid (like GitHub, Obsidian, VS Code with the Mermaid plugin):

sequenceDiagram
    actor User
    participant Angular as Angular UI
    participant Api as API Layer
    participant App as Application Layer
    participant Domain as Domain Layer
    participant Infra as Infrastructure (DB)

    User ->> Angular: Fill out "Add User" form & click submit
    Angular ->> Api: HTTP POST /users (UserDTO)
    Api ->> App: Call AddUserHandler.Execute(UserDTO)
    App ->> Domain: Create User entity (validate rules)
    Domain ->> Domain: Run business rules (unique email, password validity)
    App ->> Infra: IUsersRepository.Add(User)
    Infra ->> Infra: Persist User to Database
    Infra -->> App: Return saved User (with ID)
    App -->> Api: Return UserResponseDTO
    Api -->> Angular: HTTP 201 Created + UserResponseDTO
    Angular -->> User: Show "User added successfully"


👉 Do you want me to also make a layered box diagram in Mermaid (instead of sequence) showing how Angular → Api → App → Domain → Infra connect for this use case? That would complement the flow above.

You said:
that doesn't look right... i thought mermaid uses three back ticks?
ChatGPT said:

You’re totally right 👍 — Mermaid in Markdown does use three backticks with mermaid specified. Here’s the corrected version of your Add User sequence diagram:

sequenceDiagram
    actor User
    participant Angular as Angular UI
    participant Api as API Layer
    participant App as Application Layer
    participant Domain as Domain Layer
    participant Infra as Infrastructure (DB)

    User ->> Angular: Fill out "Add User" form & click submit
    Angular ->> Api: HTTP POST /users (UserDTO)
    Api ->> App: Call AddUserHandler.Execute(UserDTO)
    App ->> Domain: Create User entity (validate rules)
    Domain ->> Domain: Run business rules (unique email, password validity)
    App ->> Infra: IUsersRepository.Add(User)
    Infra ->> Infra: Persist User to Database
    Infra -->> App: Return saved User (with ID)
    App -->> Api: Return UserResponseDTO
    Api -->> Angular: HTTP 201 Created + UserResponseDTO
    Angular -->> User: Show "User added successfully"


👉 If you paste that into a Markdown file on GitHub, GitLab, Obsidian, or VS Code with Mermaid preview, it’ll render properly.

Want me to also give you a layered box diagram in Mermaid (instead of sequence) so you can visualize which layers depend on which for this same “Add User” use case?

You said:
okay... show me that interaction from a code snippet perspective. 
ChatGPT said:

Perfect — let’s map that “Add User” use case sequence diagram into an actual code snippet flow across your layers. This way you see how the pieces wire together.

🧩 Code Snippet Walkthrough (C# Example)
1. Domain Layer (Entity & Rules)
// Domain/User.cs
public class User
{
    public Guid Id { get; private set; }
    public string Email { get; private set; }
    public string PasswordHash { get; private set; }

    private User() { } // for EF

    public User(string email, string passwordHash)
    {
        if (string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(email))
            throw new ArgumentException("Email required");

        // business rule: valid email format
        if (!email.Contains("@"))
            throw new ArgumentException("Invalid email format");

        Id = Guid.NewGuid();
        Email = email;
        PasswordHash = passwordHash;
    }
}

2. Application Layer (Use Case)
// Application/Users/AddUserHandler.cs
public record AddUserCommand(string Email, string Password);

public class AddUserHandler
{
    private readonly IUserRepository _repo;
    private readonly IPasswordHasher _hasher;

    public AddUserHandler(IUserRepository repo, IPasswordHasher hasher)
    {
        _repo = repo;
        _hasher = hasher;
    }

    public async Task<User> Execute(AddUserCommand cmd)
    {
        var hash = _hasher.Hash(cmd.Password);
        var user = new User(cmd.Email, hash);

        await _repo.AddAsync(user);
        return user;
    }
}

3. Infrastructure Layer (Repository Implementation)
// Infrastructure/Users/UserRepository.cs
public class UserRepository : IUserRepository
{
    private readonly AppDbContext _db;

    public UserRepository(AppDbContext db) => _db = db;

    public async Task AddAsync(User user)
    {
        _db.Users.Add(user);
        await _db.SaveChangesAsync();
    }
}

4. API Layer (Controller Endpoint)
// Api/Controllers/UsersController.cs
[ApiController]
[Route("api/[controller]")]
public class UsersController : ControllerBase
{
    private readonly AddUserHandler _handler;

    public UsersController(AddUserHandler handler)
    {
        _handler = handler;
    }

    [HttpPost]
    public async Task<IActionResult> AddUser([FromBody] AddUserDto dto)
    {
        var user = await _handler.Execute(new AddUserCommand(dto.Email, dto.Password));
        return CreatedAtAction(nameof(AddUser), new { id = user.Id }, new { user.Id, user.Email });
    }
}

public record AddUserDto(string Email, string Password);

5. Angular (Frontend Service Call)
// Angular service (users.service.ts)
addUser(user: { email: string, password: string }): Observable<any> {
  return this.http.post('/api/users', user);
}

🔗 Flow Recap

Angular → POST /api/users

API → Maps request to AddUserCommand → calls AddUserHandler

App Layer → Creates domain User, enforces rules, hashes password, calls repository

Infra Layer → Saves entity in database

Domain → Defines business rules (email must be valid, etc.)

✅ This matches your sequence diagram, but now in code.

Do you want me to also show you a unit test example for AddUserHandler so you can see how the SOLID layering makes it easily testable?

You said:
can we do UpdateUser now?
ChatGPT said:

Great idea 👍 — let’s mirror the AddUser pattern, but now implement UpdateUser across your layers.

🧩 Code Snippet Walkthrough — UpdateUser
1. Domain Layer (Entity with Update Method)
// Domain/User.cs
public class User
{
    public Guid Id { get; private set; }
    public string Email { get; private set; }
    public string PasswordHash { get; private set; }

    private User() { } // for EF

    public User(string email, string passwordHash)
    {
        Id = Guid.NewGuid();
        Update(email, passwordHash);
    }

    // Business rule: update user info safely
    public void Update(string email, string passwordHash)
    {
        if (string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(email))
            throw new ArgumentException("Email required");

        if (!email.Contains("@"))
            throw new ArgumentException("Invalid email format");

        Email = email;
        PasswordHash = passwordHash;
    }
}

2. Application Layer (Use Case Handler)
// Application/Users/UpdateUserHandler.cs
public record UpdateUserCommand(Guid Id, string Email, string Password);

public class UpdateUserHandler
{
    private readonly IUserRepository _repo;
    private readonly IPasswordHasher _hasher;

    public UpdateUserHandler(IUserRepository repo, IPasswordHasher hasher)
    {
        _repo = repo;
        _hasher = hasher;
    }

    public async Task<User> Execute(UpdateUserCommand cmd)
    {
        var user = await _repo.GetByIdAsync(cmd.Id);
        if (user is null)
            throw new InvalidOperationException("User not found");

        var hash = _hasher.Hash(cmd.Password);
        user.Update(cmd.Email, hash);

        await _repo.UpdateAsync(user);
        return user;
    }
}

3. Infrastructure Layer (Repository Update Implementation)
// Infrastructure/Users/UserRepository.cs
public class UserRepository : IUserRepository
{
    private readonly AppDbContext _db;

    public UserRepository(AppDbContext db) => _db = db;

    public async Task<User?> GetByIdAsync(Guid id) =>
        await _db.Users.FindAsync(id);

    public async Task UpdateAsync(User user)
    {
        _db.Users.Update(user);
        await _db.SaveChangesAsync();
    }
}

4. API Layer (Controller Endpoint)
// Api/Controllers/UsersController.cs
[HttpPut("{id:guid}")]
public async Task<IActionResult> UpdateUser(Guid id, [FromBody] UpdateUserDto dto)
{
    var user = await _updateHandler.Execute(
        new UpdateUserCommand(id, dto.Email, dto.Password));

    return Ok(new { user.Id, user.Email });
}

public record UpdateUserDto(string Email, string Password);

5. Angular (Frontend Service Call)
// Angular service (users.service.ts)
updateUser(id: string, user: { email: string, password: string }): Observable<any> {
  return this.http.put(`/api/users/${id}`, user);
}

🔗 Flow

Angular → sends PUT /api/users/{id} with new data.

API → Maps DTO to UpdateUserCommand.

App (Use Case) → Loads User, applies update rules, saves back.

Domain → Validates new state (business rules).

Infra → Persists update to DB.

✅ This follows SOLID:

SRP → UpdateUserHandler only updates, nothing else.

OCP → Adding DeleteUser won’t touch UpdateUser.

DIP → App depends on IUserRepository, not EF.

👉 Do you want me to also draw a Mermaid sequence diagram for UpdateUser just like we did with AddUser, so you can compare flows side by side?

You said:
and with code
ChatGPT said:

Got it 👍 — here’s the UpdateUser flow expressed as both a sequence diagram (Mermaid in Markdown) and the code snippets across layers (so you can literally map the arrows to the methods).

📊 Sequence Diagram — Update User
sequenceDiagram
    actor User
    participant Angular as Angular UI

    Angular ->> Api: HTTP PUT /users/{id} (UpdateUserDTO)
    Api ->> App: Call UpdateUserHandler.Execute(UpdateUserCommand)
    App ->> Infra: IUserRepository.GetById(id)
    Infra -->> App: Return User entity
    App ->> Domain: user.Update(newEmail, newPasswordHash)
    Domain ->> Domain: Apply validation rules (email valid, etc.)
    App ->> Infra: IUserRepository.Update(user)

    Infra -->> App: Return updated User
    App -->> Api: Return UserResponseDTO
    Api -->> Angular: HTTP 200 OK + UserResponseDTO
    Angular -->> User: Show "User updated successfully"

🧩 Code Snippet Walkthrough — UpdateUser
1. Domain Layer
public class User
{
    public Guid Id { get; private set; }
    public string Email { get; private set; }
    public string PasswordHash { get; private set; }

    public void Update(string email, string passwordHash)
    {
        if (string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(email))
            throw new ArgumentException("Email required");
        if (!email.Contains("@"))
            throw new ArgumentException("Invalid email format");

        Email = email;
        PasswordHash = passwordHash;
    }
}

2. Application Layer
public record UpdateUserCommand(Guid Id, string Email, string Password);

public class UpdateUserHandler
{
    private readonly IUserRepository _repo;
    private readonly IPasswordHasher _hasher;

    public UpdateUserHandler(IUserRepository repo, IPasswordHasher hasher)
    {
        _repo = repo;
        _hasher = hasher;
    }

    public async Task<User> Execute(UpdateUserCommand cmd)
    {
        var user = await _repo.GetByIdAsync(cmd.Id);
        if (user is null)
            throw new InvalidOperationException("User not found");

        var hash = _hasher.Hash(cmd.Password);
        user.Update(cmd.Email, hash);

        await _repo.UpdateAsync(user);
        return user;
    }
}

3. Infrastructure Layer
public class UserRepository : IUserRepository
{
    private readonly AppDbContext _db;

    public UserRepository(AppDbContext db) => _db = db;

    public async Task<User?> GetByIdAsync(Guid id) =>
        await _db.Users.FindAsync(id);

    public async Task UpdateAsync(User user)
    {
        _db.Users.Update(user);
        await _db.SaveChangesAsync();
    }
}

4. API Layer
[HttpPut("{id:guid}")]
public async Task<IActionResult> UpdateUser(Guid id, [FromBody] UpdateUserDto dto)
{
    var user = await _updateHandler.Execute(
        new UpdateUserCommand(id, dto.Email, dto.Password));

    return Ok(new { user.Id, user.Email });
}

public record UpdateUserDto(string Email, string Password);

5. Angular Service
updateUser(id: string, user: { email: string, password: string }): Observable<any> {
  return this.http.put(`/api/users/${id}`, user);
}


✅ Now you have:

Diagram showing flow across layers.

Code snippets for each layer, aligned step-by-step.

Do you want me to also show you how a unit test for UpdateUserHandler would look (mocking the repo + hasher), so you can see the SOLID separation pay off?

You said:
do we need to add the method AddUser in the domain?  is that really a business rule?
ChatGPT said:

That’s a sharp question 👌 — it cuts right to the heart of what belongs in the Domain vs what belongs in the Application layer.

🧩 Should AddUser live in the Domain?
1. What the Domain is for

The Domain Layer is where your business rules and invariants live.

Examples:

“An email must be unique”

“Passwords must meet complexity rules”

“A user must always have a role”

👉 These are rules about what a valid User is, not about how to add one to persistence.

2. What the Application layer is for

The Application Layer coordinates use cases like AddUser.

It orchestrates:

Creating a new User instance (Domain constructor or factory).

Calling validators / hashing services.

Asking the IUserRepository to persist the result.

👉 The Application layer uses the Domain, but doesn’t put orchestration logic into the Domain.

3. Where AddUser fits

You don’t want a User.AddUser(...) method in the Domain.

Instead:

User has a constructor or factory that enforces its invariants.

AddUserHandler in the Application Layer is the real use case.

So:

Domain: “What does it mean to be a valid User?”

Application: “When someone adds a user, how do we orchestrate that process?”

4. ✅ Correct separation
// Domain
public class User
{
    public User(string email, string passwordHash)
    {
        if (!email.Contains("@")) 
            throw new ArgumentException("Invalid email");
        Email = email;
        PasswordHash = passwordHash;
    }
}

// Application
public class AddUserHandler
{
    public async Task<User> Execute(AddUserCommand cmd)
    {
        var hash = _hasher.Hash(cmd.Password);
        var user = new User(cmd.Email, hash);
        await _repo.AddAsync(user);
        return user;
    }
}


Notice:

User just enforces invariants.

AddUserHandler orchestrates the add process.

🔑 Rule of Thumb

Domain defines what is valid.

Application defines what happens in a scenario.

👉 Do you want me to also contrast this with an example of what not to do (like putting AddUser in the domain) so it’s super clear where the boundary lies?

You said:
so, are you saying we need an updateuser method in the domain so we can ensure constraints are satisfied?  i would have thought that the updateuser in the app was sufficient and that we could then just verify the user still satisfied all of it's business domain constraints without ever knowing there was an update
ChatGPT said:

Excellent pushback 👌 — this is the subtle boundary between domain logic and application orchestration.

🔎 Do we need UpdateUser in the Domain?
1. Domain’s job

The Domain Layer doesn’t care about “updating” as a use case.

It only cares about state validity:

“A User must always have a valid email”

“Password hashes must not be empty”

“Usernames must be unique”

👉 So, the domain doesn’t need a method called UpdateUser(...).
What it does need are ways to change state safely while enforcing rules.

2. Application’s job

The Application Layer owns use cases like UpdateUserHandler.

That handler orchestrates:

Loading the User from a repository

Applying changes to it

Saving it back

👉 The Application doesn’t verify constraints itself. It relies on the Domain entity to enforce them.

3. The subtle point

You don’t strictly need an UpdateUser method in the Domain, but you do need something in the Domain that ensures state changes never leave the entity invalid.

Two common approaches:

Method approach

user.Update(email, passwordHash);  // enforces constraints


Setters + Invariants

user.Email = email;  // private setter enforces invariant internally


Both work, but the key is:

The Application shouldn’t be re-checking constraints.

The Domain is the guardian of invariants.

4. Rule of Thumb

Don’t put “use case methods” (AddUser, UpdateUser) in Domain.

Do put state-changing methods in Domain if they carry business rules.

Application should just call them, never re-implement constraints.

✅ So you’re right: the Application layer can say “I want to update a user.”
But the Domain layer still has to defend itself — whether that’s via an Update(...) method or invariant-enforcing properties.

👉 Want me to show you a before-and-after comparison of what happens if you don’t put the update logic in the Domain vs if you do — so you can see where bugs creep in?
