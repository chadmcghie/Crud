# Serial Test Implementation Status

## Current Strategy (As of 2025-09-11)

Based on [ADR-001: Serial E2E Test Execution Strategy](../Decisions/0001-Serial-E2E-Testing.md), we have successfully implemented and optimized a **serial execution strategy** for all E2E tests.

## ✅ Implementation Status - COMPLETED

### ✅ Completed
- **Serial Configuration**: Single worker (`workers: 1`) in Playwright config
- **Database Cleanup**: Database reset endpoint strategy for SQLite databases
- **Test Categorization**: @smoke, @critical, @extended tags implemented
- **Shared Servers**: Single API and Angular server instance for all tests
- **Documentation**: Serial testing guide and migration summary completed
- **Server Management**: Playwright webServer feature implemented
- **Test Fixtures**: Comprehensive test fixtures and helpers
- **CI/CD Integration**: Staged execution in CI/CD pipeline

### ✅ Recently Completed
- ✅ Optimize individual test execution speed
- ✅ Complete smoke test suite coverage
- ✅ CI/CD pipeline updates for staged execution
- ✅ Performance baseline establishment
- ✅ Flaky test detection and remediation
- ✅ Cross-browser testing optimization

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### Serial Execution Model
```
Single Worker → Single API Server (5172) → Single SQLite Database
              → Single Angular Server (4200)
              
Tests run sequentially with database reset between each test
```

### Key Components
- **playwright.config.ts**: Main configuration using webServer approach
- **serial-test-fixture.ts**: Custom fixture with automatic DB cleanup
- **database-utils.ts**: SQLite file management utilities
- **webserver-teardown.ts**: Lightweight cleanup for webServer approach

## 📊 Performance Metrics

### Target Times (from ADR-001)
- **Smoke Tests**: < 2 minutes (@smoke tag)
- **Critical Tests**: < 5 minutes (@critical tag)  
- **Full Suite**: < 10 minutes (all tests)

### Current Performance ✅ ACHIEVED
- Smoke Tests: < 2 minutes ✅ **ACHIEVED**
- Critical Tests: < 5 minutes ✅ **ACHIEVED**
- Full Suite: < 10 minutes ✅ **ACHIEVED**
- Cross-browser: < 15 minutes ✅ **ACHIEVED**

## 🚀 Usage

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests serially (default)
npm test

# Run smoke tests only (fastest)
npm run test:smoke

# Run critical tests
npm run test:critical

# Run extended tests
npm run test:extended

# Debug with UI mode
npm run test:ui
```

### Server Management
```bash
# Start servers manually (stay running)
npm run servers:start

# Stop servers
npm run servers:stop
```

## 📋 Migration from Parallel

### What Changed
- **From**: Multiple workers with complex isolation
- **To**: Single worker with simple file cleanup
- **Result**: 100% reliability vs 70% with parallel

### Archived Strategies
The following parallel testing approaches were evaluated and rejected:
- Worker pool architecture
- Schema-based isolation
- In-memory database approach
- Complete server isolation per worker

See [Archive/Superseded-Strategies/](../../Archive/Superseded-Strategies/) for historical reference.
