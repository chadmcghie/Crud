## Styles & Philosophies
- **Monolith vs Microservices vs Modular Monolith** → Deployment boundaries.  
- **Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)** → Reusable services with contracts.  
- **Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)** → Loosely coupled, async communication.  
- **Service Mesh** → Observability, routing, and security for microservices.  
- **API-First / Contract-First** → Treat APIs as stable contracts.

## Distributed Systems Concepts
- **CAP Theorem** → Trade-offs between Consistency, Availability, Partition Tolerance.  
- **BASE vs ACID** → Eventual consistency vs strict consistency.  
- **Idempotency** → Safe retries in distributed calls.  
- **Consensus** → Raft, Paxos, leader election for reliability.  
- **Data Sharding & Replication** → Scale out storage & resilience.

## Scalability & Performance
- **Load Balancing** → Distribute requests fairly.  
- **Caching Layers** → In-memory, distributed, edge (CDN).  
- **CQRS + Event Sourcing** → Optimize reads/writes at scale.  
- **Asynchronous Processing** → Queues, pub/sub, background workers.

## Reliability & Operations
- **Chaos Engineering** → Test resilience by injecting failures.  
- **Resiliency Patterns** → Circuit breakers, retries, bulkheads (e.g., Polly).  
- **Blue-Green / Canary Deployments** → Safer releases.  
- **Observability** → Logs, metrics, traces built in.

## Data & Integration
- **Polyglot Persistence** → Choose DB per use-case (SQL, NoSQL, Graph).  
- **ETL / Data Pipelines** → Moving data across systems.  
- **Data Mesh** → Federated domain-owned data approach.

## Governance & Evolution
- **Conway’s Law** → Org structure mirrors architecture.  
- **Evolutionary Architecture** → Design for change.  
- **Strangler Fig Pattern** → Gradually replace legacy systems.  
- **Governance Models** → Centralized vs federated decisions.

## Cloud-Native Principles

- **12-Factor App** → Cloud portability best practices.  
- **Immutable Infrastructure** → Rebuild, don’t patch.  
- **Containers & Orchestration** → Docker, Kubernetes.  
- **Serverless Architectures** → Event-driven FaaS for bursty workloads.
