# Staging Deployment Issues

## Issue 1: Staging Deployment Not Actually Deploying

**Problem**: The staging deployment workflow (`deploy-staging.yml`) successfully runs but doesn't actually deploy anywhere. It's using placeholder commands.

**Location**: `.github/workflows/deploy-staging.yml` lines 272-279

**Current State**:
```yaml
- name: Deploy to staging
  run: |
    echo "ðŸš€ Deploying to staging environment..."
    echo "Version: ${{ github.sha }}"
    # Replace this section with actual deployment commands
    echo "url=https://staging.your-app.com" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
```

**Impact**: 
- No actual staging environment exists
- The workflow shows "success" but nothing is deployed
- Team can't test features in staging before production

**Solution Required**:
You need to configure actual deployment based on your hosting platform:
- Azure App Service (lines 234-240)
- AWS Elastic Beanstalk (lines 242-252)  
- Docker/Kubernetes (lines 254-261)
- IIS/Windows Server (lines 263-269)

## Issue 2: Smoke Test Failures in CI

**Problem**: E2E smoke tests are failing with timeout errors when trying to locate page elements.

**Symptoms**:
- TimeoutError after 5000ms waiting for elements
- Failed tests:
  - People Management tests
  - People Module navigation tests
  - Roles Module navigation test
- 5 tests failed, 22 passed

**Possible Causes**:
1. **Timeout too short**: 5-second timeout might be insufficient in CI environment
2. **Server startup issues**: Servers may not be fully ready when tests start
3. **Performance issues**: CI environment may be slower than local

**Recommended Fixes**:

### 1. Increase timeout for CI environments
In `playwright.config.ts`, adjust timeout based on environment:
```typescript
timeout: process.env.CI ? 60000 : 30000,  // 60s in CI, 30s locally
```

### 2. Add better wait conditions
Update test selectors to wait for specific conditions:
```typescript
await page.waitForSelector('app-people-list', { 
  state: 'visible',
  timeout: 30000 
});
```

### 3. Add retry logic for flaky tests
Configure retries for CI:
```typescript
retries: process.env.CI ? 2 : 0,  // Retry failed tests in CI
```

### 4. Improve server readiness checks
Ensure servers are fully ready before tests start:
```typescript
webServer: {
  command: 'dotnet run',
  url: 'http://localhost:5172/health',
  timeout: 120 * 1000,  // Increase startup timeout
  reuseExistingServer: false,  // Always fresh in CI
}
```

## Action Items

1. **Configure actual staging deployment**:
   - Choose hosting platform
   - Set up necessary secrets in GitHub
   - Update `deploy-staging.yml` with real deployment commands

2. **Fix smoke test reliability**:
   - Increase timeouts for CI
   - Add better wait conditions in tests
   - Consider adding retries for flaky tests
   - Review server startup configuration

3. **Monitor and iterate**:
   - Track test failure patterns
   - Adjust timeouts based on actual CI performance
   - Consider splitting smoke tests into smaller chunks
