# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: JWT Authentication Implementation
> Created: 2025-08-29
> Status: COMPLETED

## Overview

Implement secure JWT-based authentication system that enables users to register, login, and access protected resources using token-based authentication. This feature will provide the foundation for all authentication and authorization functionality in the application, supporting both access and refresh tokens for enhanced security.

## User Stories

### User Registration and Login

As a new user, I want to register for an account using my email and password, so that I can access the application's protected features.

Users will navigate to the registration page, enter their email address and a secure password that meets complexity requirements (minimum 8 characters, including uppercase, lowercase, number, and special character). Upon successful registration, the system will create their account and automatically log them in, issuing JWT tokens for immediate access. Existing users can login with their credentials and receive access and refresh tokens that persist their session.

### Secure Token Management

As an authenticated user, I want my session to remain secure with automatic token refresh, so that I don't have to repeatedly login while maintaining security.

The application will use short-lived access tokens (15 minutes) paired with longer-lived refresh tokens (7 days) stored in HTTP-only cookies. When an access token expires during active use, the system will automatically use the refresh token to obtain a new access token without interrupting the user experience. Users will only need to re-authenticate when their refresh token expires after 7 days of use.

### Protected Resource Access

As an authenticated user, I want to access protected API endpoints and application features, so that I can use the full functionality of the application based on my assigned role.

Once authenticated, users will have their JWT tokens automatically included in API requests to protected endpoints. The system will validate tokens on each request, checking both token validity and user roles/permissions. Users will be able to access resources according to their assigned roles (Admin, User), with clear error messages when attempting to access unauthorized resources.

## Spec Scope

1. **JWT Token Generation and Validation** - Implement secure token generation using industry-standard libraries with proper signing and validation
2. **User Registration and Login Endpoints** - Create API endpoints for user registration and login with proper validation and error handling
3. **Token Refresh Mechanism** - Implement refresh token flow to maintain user sessions without compromising security
4. **Password Security** - Implement proper password hashing using BCrypt and enforce password complexity requirements
5. **Role-Based Authorization** - Support Admin and User roles with attribute-based authorization on protected endpoints

## Out of Scope

- Multi-factor authentication (MFA)
- Social login providers (OAuth)
- Email verification for registration
- Password reset functionality (will be separate spec)
- Account lockout mechanisms
- Session management UI for viewing active sessions

## Expected Deliverable

1. Users can successfully register new accounts and login with email/password credentials
2. Protected API endpoints return 401 for unauthenticated requests and 403 for unauthorized requests
3. Tokens automatically refresh during active use without requiring re-authentication

## Implementation Summary

**Status: COMPLETED** - JWT authentication successfully implemented with all requirements met:

- Full Clean Architecture implementation across Domain, Application, Infrastructure, and API layers
- Secure password hashing using BCrypt.Net-Next
- JWT token generation and validation with access/refresh token pattern
- HTTP-only cookies for refresh token storage
- Role-based authorization (Admin, User) with policy-based access control
- Complete test coverage including unit, integration, and E2E tests
- All deliverables achieved with proper authentication flow and automatic token refresh
