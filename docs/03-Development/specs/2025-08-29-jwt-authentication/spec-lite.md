# Spec Summary (Lite)

**Status: COMPLETED**

Implement secure JWT-based authentication system with user registration, login, and token-based access control using access tokens (15 minutes) and refresh tokens (7 days) stored in HTTP-only cookies. The system will support email/password authentication with BCrypt hashing, automatic token refresh, and role-based authorization (Admin, User roles) for protecting API endpoints and application resources.
