# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Angular Authentication Frontend
> Created: 2025-09-06
> GitHub Issue: #42 - Authentication Authorization

## Overview

Implement a complete Angular frontend authentication system that integrates with the existing .NET backend JWT authentication API. This feature will provide user registration, login, secure route protection, and automatic token management to enable secure access control in the Angular application.

## User Stories

### User Registration and Login

As a new user, I want to register for an account and log in, so that I can access protected features of the application.

Users will navigate to a registration page where they can enter their email and password. After successful registration, they will be automatically logged in and redirected to the dashboard. Existing users can use the login page to authenticate with their credentials. The system will store JWT tokens securely and automatically attach them to API requests.

### Secure Session Management

As an authenticated user, I want my session to persist across page refreshes and automatically refresh when needed, so that I don't have to repeatedly log in during active use.

The application will store tokens appropriately, automatically refresh them before expiration using the refresh token cookie, and gracefully handle session expiration by redirecting to the login page when necessary.

### Protected Route Access

As a user, I want to only see and access features appropriate to my role, so that the application provides a secure and relevant experience.

The application will implement route guards to protect sensitive routes, show/hide UI elements based on user roles (Admin/User), and redirect unauthorized access attempts to appropriate pages.

## Spec Scope

1. **Authentication Service** - Angular service for login, register, logout, and token management with RxJS observables
2. **Login/Register Components** - Reactive forms with validation, error handling, and loading states
3. **Auth Guards and Interceptors** - Route protection, automatic token attachment, and 401 response handling
4. **Token Management** - JWT storage, automatic refresh, and expiration handling
5. **User Context and UI Updates** - Current user state management and role-based UI rendering

## Out of Scope

- Password reset flow (separate feature - issue #101)
- Social authentication providers
- Two-factor authentication
- User profile management beyond basic authentication
- Backend authentication changes (already completed)

## Expected Deliverable

1. Users can successfully register new accounts and log in through Angular UI forms
2. Protected routes are inaccessible without authentication and redirect to login when needed
3. API requests automatically include JWT tokens and handle token refresh transparently
