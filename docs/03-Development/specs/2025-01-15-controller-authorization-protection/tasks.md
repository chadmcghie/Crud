- [ ] Add `[Authorize(Policy = "UserOrAdmin")]` to GET endpoints
- [ ] Add `[Authorize(Policy = "AdminOnly")]` to POST, PUT, DELETE endpoints
- [ ] Test authorization with different user roles
- [ ] Update integration tests for RolesController

**Estimated Time**: 30 minutes
**Priority**: High
**Dependencies**: None

#### Task 1.3: Secure WallsController

**Priority**: High
**Dependencies**: None

### Phase 2: Testing and Validation

#### Task 2.1: Update Integration Tests
- [ ] Update PeopleController integration tests to include authentication
- [ ] Update RolesController integration tests to include authentication
- [ ] Update WallsController integration tests to include authentication
- [ ] Update WindowsController integration tests to include authentication
- [ ] Add tests for unauthorized access scenarios (401/403)
- [ ] Add tests for role-based access control (User vs Admin)

**Estimated Time**: 2 hours
**Priority**: High
**Dependencies**: Phase 1 completion

#### Task 2.2: End-to-End Testing
- [ ] Test complete authentication flow with protected endpoints
- [ ] Verify Angular frontend works with protected API
- [ ] Test token refresh with protected endpoints
- [ ] Verify error handling for expired tokens
- [ ] Test role-based UI behavior

**Estimated Time**: 1 hour
**Priority**: Medium
**Dependencies**: Phase 2.1 completion

### Phase 3: Documentation and Cleanup

#### Task 3.1: Update API Documentation
- [ ] Update Swagger configuration to show authentication requirements
- [ ] Update API documentation to reflect protected endpoints
- [ ] Add authentication examples to API documentation
- [ ] Update OpenAPI specification

**Estimated Time**: 30 minutes
**Priority**: Medium
**Dependencies**: Phase 2 completion

#### Task 3.2: Update Project Documentation
- [ ] Update Critical Issues Summary to reflect completion
- [ ] Update roadmap to correct authentication status
- [ ] Update README with authentication requirements
- [ ] Create completion summary document

**Estimated Time**: 30 minutes
**Priority**: Medium
**Dependencies**: Phase 3.1 completion

## Implementation Order

1. **PeopleController** (Start with most commonly used)
2. **RolesController** (Core to authorization system)
3. **WallsController** (Business logic)
4. **WindowsController** (Business logic)
5. **Integration Tests** (Validate all changes)
6. **End-to-End Testing** (Full system validation)
7. **Documentation Updates** (Complete the work)

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- Test authorization attributes are properly applied
- Test role-based access control logic
- Test error handling for unauthorized access

### Integration Testing
- Test API endpoints with authentication
- Test unauthorized access returns 401/403
- Test authorized access works correctly
- Test role-based access control

### End-to-End Testing
- Test complete user workflow with authentication
- Test Angular frontend integration
- Test token refresh functionality
- Test error handling and user experience

## Risk Mitigation

### Potential Issues
- **Breaking Changes**: Existing tests may fail
- **Frontend Integration**: Angular may need updates
- **API Documentation**: Swagger may need configuration

### Mitigation
- **Incremental Implementation**: One controller at a time
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Test all scenarios
- **Documentation**: Update all relevant documentation
- **Rollback Plan**: Keep changes minimal and reversible

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All business controllers require authentication
- [ ] Role-based access control is enforced
- [ ] Integration tests pass with authentication
- [ ] End-to-end tests pass
- [ ] API documentation is updated
- [ ] Project documentation reflects completion
- [ ] No breaking changes to existing functionality
