# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Technical Requirements

### Domain Layer Changes
- Create ICacheKeyGenerator interface for consistent cache key generation across the application
- Add CacheableAttribute for marking queries and entities that should be cached
- Define cache invalidation events that can be raised when domain entities are modified

### Application Layer Changes
- Implement CachingBehavior<TRequest, TResponse> for MediatR pipeline to intercept and cache query results
- Create ICacheService abstraction with methods for Get, Set, Remove, and Exists operations
- Add cache configuration DTOs for TTL settings, cache regions, and invalidation rules
- Implement cache invalidation handlers that respond to domain events from Create/Update/Delete commands

### Infrastructure Layer Changes
- Implement RedisCacheService using StackExchange.Redis for distributed caching scenarios
- Create LazyCacheService wrapper for optimized in-process caching with LazyCache
- Implement CompositeCacheService that manages both Redis and LazyCache with automatic fallback
- Add cache key generator implementation with support for parameterized queries
- Create repository decorators that wrap existing repositories with caching logic
- Implement cache health check service for monitoring Redis connectivity

### Presentation Layer Changes
- Add OutputCacheAttribute for API endpoints with configurable cache duration and vary-by parameters
- Implement cache management controller with endpoints for clearing cache and viewing statistics
- Add cache metrics endpoint exposing hit/miss ratios, memory usage, and key counts
- Configure Redis connection in appsettings.json with connection string and options
- Update Program.cs to register caching services and configure middleware pipeline

### Integration Requirements
- Integrate with existing Polly resilience policies for Redis connection failures
- Connect cache metrics to Serilog for centralized logging
- Ensure cache operations work within existing Unit of Work pattern
- Support both development (SQLite) and production (SQL Server) database scenarios

### Performance Criteria
- Cache operations must complete within 10ms for in-memory, 50ms for Redis
- Support minimum 10,000 cached items without memory pressure
- Achieve >80% cache hit ratio for frequently accessed data
- Handle Redis disconnection gracefully with <100ms failover to in-memory

## External Dependencies

**StackExchange.Redis** - High-performance Redis client for .NET
**Justification:** Industry-standard Redis client with excellent performance, connection pooling, and resilience features. Required for distributed caching across multiple application instances.

**LazyCache** - Thread-safe in-memory caching with lazy loading
**Justification:** Provides double-checked locking pattern for cache population, preventing cache stampedes and improving performance for single-instance deployments.

**Microsoft.Extensions.Caching.StackExchangeRedis** - Redis IDistributedCache implementation
**Justification:** Provides seamless integration with ASP.NET Core's distributed caching abstractions, enabling use of existing cache tag helpers and output caching features.
