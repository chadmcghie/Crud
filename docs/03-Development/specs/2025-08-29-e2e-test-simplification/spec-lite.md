# Spec Summary (Lite)

**Status: COMPLETED**

Simplify E2E test infrastructure to align with ADR-001 by implementing single-worker serial execution, removing all parallel complexity, and using simple SQLite file-based cleanup. This will achieve 100% test reliability while maintaining sub-10-minute execution times through basic server management and straightforward CI integration.

**Implementation Note:** Successfully completed using Playwright's webServer configuration, achieving all reliability and performance targets with a simpler approach than originally specified.
