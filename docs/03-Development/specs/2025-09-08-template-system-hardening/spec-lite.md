# Template System Hardening

## Overview
Enhance and harden the Agent OS template system to support complex enterprise scenarios with full type safety, comprehensive patterns, and production-ready code generation.

## Problem Statement
The current template system provides basic functionality but lacks:
- Type system mapping between languages
- Database migration templates
- Test generation capabilities
- Complex relationship handling
- Production-ready patterns

## Solution
Implement a comprehensive template hardening that includes:
- Full type system mapping between C# and TypeScript
- Entity Framework Core migration templates
- Test generation for multiple frameworks
- Validation templates
- Complex relationship support
- Error handling and retry patterns
- Performance optimization patterns
- MediatR patterns
- Security templates

## Success Criteria
- All templates generate compilable code
- Type mappings are accurate between languages
- Generated tests pass
- Complex relationships are properly handled
- Performance patterns are implemented correctly

## Dependencies
- Existing template system from Task 3
- Template engine infrastructure
- Agent OS core functionality
