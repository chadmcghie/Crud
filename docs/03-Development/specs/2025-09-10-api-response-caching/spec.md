> GitHub Issue: #94 - Caching Sub-Task 4: API Response Caching

## Overview

Implement comprehensive API response caching using ASP.NET Core output caching middleware and HTTP response headers to improve application performance and reduce server load. This feature will complete the caching infrastructure by adding HTTP-level caching to complement the existing Redis repository and CQRS query caching layers.

## User Stories

### Performance-Conscious API Consumer

As an API consumer, I want frequently requested data to be served from cache, so that I experience faster response times and reduced latency.

When making repeated requests to endpoints like GET /api/people or GET /api/roles, the system should serve cached responses for a configured duration, reducing database queries and improving response times from hundreds of milliseconds to tens of milliseconds.

### System Administrator

As a system administrator, I want configurable caching policies per endpoint, so that I can optimize performance based on data volatility and business requirements.

The system should allow different cache durations for different endpoints (e.g., 5 minutes for People data, 1 hour for Roles data) and provide cache invalidation mechanisms when data changes occur.

### Developer

As a developer, I want proper HTTP caching headers in API responses, so that client applications and CDNs can implement their own caching strategies effectively.

API responses should include appropriate Cache-Control, ETag, and Last-Modified headers that enable client-side caching and conditional requests, reducing unnecessary network traffic.

## Spec Scope

1. **Output Caching Middleware** - Implement ASP.NET Core output caching for API endpoints with configurable policies
2. **HTTP Response Headers** - Add proper Cache-Control, ETag, and Last-Modified headers to API responses  
3. **Cache Invalidation** - Automatic cache invalidation when data is modified through CUD operations
4. **Conditional Requests** - Support for If-None-Match and If-Modified-Since headers for efficient client caching
5. **Cache Policies** - Configurable caching policies per endpoint based on data volatility

## Out of Scope

- Client-side caching implementation (Angular HTTP interceptors)
- CDN configuration and setup
- Cache warming strategies
- Advanced cache partitioning by user roles or tenants

## Expected Deliverable

1. API endpoints return cached responses with sub-100ms response times for repeated requests
2. HTTP responses include proper caching headers (Cache-Control, ETag, Last-Modified)
3. Cache automatically invalidates when underlying data changes through POST/PUT/DELETE operations
