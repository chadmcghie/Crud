# Product Mission (Lite)

CRUD Template is an enterprise-ready starter template that helps development teams rapidly bootstrap new CRUD-heavy applications by providing a pre-configured, architecturally sound foundation with Clean Architecture, comprehensive testing, and best practices already implemented.

This template serves development and architectural teams who need to quickly start new projects with consistent patterns and comprehensive testing. Unlike basic scaffolding tools, it provides a complete Clean Architecture implementation with CQRS, a full testing pyramid, and production-ready infrastructure, reducing project setup time from weeks to hours while ensuring adherence to enterprise best practices.
