# Agent OS Learning Cache

This directory contains accumulated knowledge from resolved issues and common patterns encountered during development.

## Structure

- `patterns.md` - Common issue-solution pairs organized by category
- `memory-references.md` - References to important memory IDs for context
- `github-actions-log-retrieval.md` - GitHub Actions knowledge (merged from knowledge folder)
- `solutions/` - Detailed solution guides for complex issues (future)

## Purpose

The learning cache helps Agent OS:
1. **Quickly resolve known issues** - Match error patterns to proven solutions
2. **Avoid repeated mistakes** - Learn from past failures
3. **Share knowledge** - Accumulate team wisdom over time
4. **Improve efficiency** - Reduce time debugging known problems

## Categories

### Testing Patterns
- Database locking issues
- Test isolation problems
- Flaky test solutions
- Performance optimizations

### Build Patterns
- Compilation optimizations
- Dependency issues
- Configuration problems

### CI/CD Patterns
- GitHub Actions log retrieval
- Workflow debugging
- Pipeline optimization

### Feature Patterns
- Common implementation patterns
- Architecture decisions
- Reusable solutions

## Usage

When encountering an issue:
1. Search this directory for similar patterns
2. Apply proven solutions
3. Add new patterns when resolved

## Contributing

Add new patterns with:
- Clear problem description
- Solution steps
- Code examples where applicable
- Links to related documentation
