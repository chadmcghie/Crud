# Documentation Reorganization Summary
Date: 2025-08-28

## Changes Made

### 1. Created New Folders
- **`docs/03-Development/`** - Added missing folder for development guides
- **`docs/Archive/Superseded-Strategies/`** - Archive for outdated documentation

### 2. Moved Files to Appropriate Locations

#### To Archive (Superseded by Serial Testing Strategy)
These files document the parallel testing approach that was abandoned:
- `PARALLEL-TESTING-GUIDE.md` → Archive
- `PARALLEL-EXECUTION-GUIDE.md` → Archive  
- `ISOLATION-PROBLEM-EXPLAINED.md` → Archive
- `PRAGMATIC-SOLUTION.md` → Archive
- `CRITICAL-FLAWS-IN-PRAGMATIC-SOLUTION.md` → Archive
- `CRITICAL-ANALYSIS-WHAT-COULD-GO-WRONG.md` → Archive

#### To Testing Folder (Current Strategy)
Moved active testing documentation to Quality Control:
- `SERIAL-TESTING-GUIDE.md` → `05-Quality Control/Testing/`
- `SERIAL-TEST-OPTIMIZATION-PLAN.md` → `05-Quality Control/Testing/`
- `E2E-Test-Migration-Summary.md` → `05-Quality Control/Testing/`

#### To Development Folder
Moved development guides to new folder:
- `SETUP-GUIDE.md` → `03-Development/`
- `Development-Workflow.md` → `03-Development/`
- `POLLY_IMPROVEMENTS.md` → `03-Development/`

### 3. Updated Links
- Fixed link in `SERIAL-TESTING-GUIDE.md` to point to new location of migration summary
- Updated `docs/README.md` to reflect new folder structure
- Fixed broken Architecture Guidelines link in main README

### 4. Created Documentation Index
- Added `DOCUMENTATION-INDEX.md` as comprehensive map of all documentation
- Clearly marked current vs superseded strategies
- Provided reading order for new developers

## Key Insight: Serial Testing is Current Strategy

Based on file dates and ADR-001 (2025-08-28), the project has definitively adopted **serial E2E testing** due to:
- SQLite limitations with concurrent access
- Entity Framework Core constraints
- Prioritizing reliability over theoretical speed

All parallel testing documentation has been archived for historical reference.
