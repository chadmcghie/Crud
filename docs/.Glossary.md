# Glossary

## A

**ADR (Architecture Decision Record)**: A document that captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences.

**API**: Application Programming Interface - defines how software components should interact.

## C

**CI/CD**: Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment - automated processes for building, testing, and deploying code.

**Clean Architecture**: An architectural pattern that separates concerns into layers with dependency rules.

**CQRS**: Command Query Responsibility Segregation - a pattern that separates read and write operations.

**CRUD**: Create, Read, Update, Delete - basic operations performed on data.

## D

**DDD**: Domain-Driven Design - an approach to software development focusing on the business domain.

**Dependency Injection**: A design pattern for achieving Inversion of Control between classes and their dependencies.

**Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**: The fifth SOLID principle stating that high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions. Abstractions should not depend on details; details should depend on abstractions.

## E

**E2E Testing**: End-to-End testing - tests that validate the entire application flow.

**Entity Framework**: Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) framework for .NET.

## I

**Integration Testing**: Testing that verifies the interaction between different components or systems.

**Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**: The fourth SOLID principle stating that clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they don't use. Many specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface.

**IoC**: Inversion of Control - a design principle where control flow is inverted compared to traditional programming.

## L

**Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**: The third SOLID principle stating that objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without breaking the application. Derived classes must be substitutable for their base classes.

## M

**MediatR**: A .NET library implementing the mediator pattern for decoupling request handling.

**Microservices**: An architectural style that structures an application as a collection of loosely coupled services.

## O

**Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**: The second SOLID principle stating that software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification.

## P

**Polly**: A .NET resilience and transient-fault-handling library.

## S

**Serial Testing**: Running tests one after another rather than in parallel to avoid conflicts.

**Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: The first SOLID principle stating that a class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one job or responsibility.

**SOLID**: A mnemonic acronym for five design principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable:
- **S** - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- **O** - Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
- **L** - Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
- **I** - Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
- **D** - Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

## U

**Unit Testing**: Testing individual components in isolation.

## X

**xUnit**: A unit testing framework for .NET applications.
