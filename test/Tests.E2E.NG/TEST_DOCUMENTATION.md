## Test Summary

- **Total Tests**: 79
- **Angular UI Tests**: 28
- **API Tests**: 45
- **Integration Tests**: 6
- **Tests with C# Wrappers**: 79 (100%)

## Notes

- All tests are wrapped with C# test methods for Visual Studio Test Explorer visibility
- Each C# wrapper executes the corresponding Playwright test using the `dotnet playwright test` command
- Test results are properly reported back to Visual Studio's Test Explorer
- The wrapper tests maintain the same naming convention as the original TypeScript tests
