# E2E Test Failures in Staging Deployment Pipeline

## Problem Statement
GitHub Actions staging deployment pipeline is consistently failing with 10 E2E test failures, preventing successful deployment validation. **Critical Pattern**: These failures typically occur during promotion to staging (not during PR to dev), indicating environment-specific issues. Tests are timing out when loading key application components and encountering security errors when accessing localStorage.

## Symptoms
- TimeoutError: Components 'app-people-list' and 'app-roles-list' fail to load within 5000ms timeout
- SecurityError: "Failed to read the 'localStorage' property from 'Window'"
- Multiple test failures across People Management and Roles Module test suites
- Tests stopped after reaching 10 maximum allowed failures
- Overall test run: 2 did not run, 15 passed, 10 failed in ~4.3 minutes

## Impact
- Staging deployment pipeline blocked
- Pull request #176 merge validation failed
- Prevents deployment of new features to staging environment
- Affects confidence in production deployment readiness
- 10 test scenarios affected across People and Roles modules

## Root Cause Analysis (Five Whys)
1. Why did the E2E tests fail in staging?
   Answer: Components failed to load within timeout and localStorage access was denied

2. Why are components failing to load within timeout?
   Answer: Potential performance degradation or environment configuration issues in staging

3. Why is localStorage access being denied?
   Answer: Security policy differences between local and CI/staging environments

4. Why are there environment configuration differences?
   Answer: Staging environment may have stricter security policies or different browser settings

5. Why weren't these issues caught in local testing?
   Answer: Local development environment doesn't replicate staging security constraints and performance characteristics (ROOT CAUSE)

## Attempted Solutions

### Attempt 1: Environment Configuration Analysis & Timeout Fixes
**Approach**: Analyzed environment differences and implemented comprehensive timeout and browser security fixes
**Result**: Applied fixes targeting root causes
**Files Modified**: 
- `test/Tests.E2E.NG/playwright.config.ts` - Increased timeouts and added browser security flags
- `test/Tests.E2E.NG/tests/helpers/page-helpers.ts` - Enhanced wait strategies for CI environment
**Key Learning**: Staging environment requires different timeout and security configurations than local development

**Specific Changes Made**:
1. **Timeout Increases**: 
   - Global test timeout: 30s → 60s in CI
   - Component expect timeout: 5s → 10s in CI
   - Page helper timeouts: 10s → 15s in CI

2. **Browser Security Flags Added**:
   - `--disable-features=VizDisplayCompositor`
   - `--allow-running-insecure-content`
   - `--disable-background-timer-throttling`
   - Additional CI-specific flags for extensions and background processes

3. **Enhanced Wait Strategies**:
   - Added component interactivity checks in CI
   - Improved component loading detection
   - Better handling of async component initialization

## Strategic Changes (DO NOT ROLLBACK)
The following changes implement critical staging environment compatibility:

1. **Playwright Configuration (`playwright.config.ts`)**:
   - Environment-aware timeout scaling for CI reliability
   - Browser security flags for localStorage access in CI
   - Staging-specific browser launch options

2. **Page Helper Strategies (`page-helpers.ts`)**:
   - CI-aware component loading detection
   - Enhanced wait strategies for slower staging builds
   - Component interactivity verification for CI environments

These changes ensure staging deployment validation without breaking local development.

## Current Workaround
None available - deployment pipeline blocked

## Acceptance Criteria
**All checks must pass for both PR to dev AND staging deployment phases:**
- [ ] PR to dev: All E2E tests pass during pull request validation
- [ ] Staging deployment: All E2E tests pass during promotion to staging environment
- [ ] No timeout errors on component loading (app-people-list, app-roles-list)
- [ ] No localStorage security errors in CI environment
- [ ] All async/await patterns properly implemented
- [ ] Zero test failures in staging deployment pipeline

## Next Steps
- [x] Compare staging vs local environment configurations
- [x] Investigate localStorage security policies in CI environment
- [x] Review component loading performance in staging
- [x] Check for async/await issues flagged in the failure logs
- [x] Analyze if timeout values need adjustment for staging environment
- [x] Review browser security settings in GitHub Actions
- [ ] Test fixes in staging deployment pipeline
- [ ] Verify acceptance criteria are met
- [ ] Consider marking issue as resolved if staging tests pass
